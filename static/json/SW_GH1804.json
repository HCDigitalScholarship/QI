Many extraordinary natural curiosities have\n                    fallen under our observation, in the diversified appearance of mountains,\n                    rocks and valleys. We have passed to-day the most ponderous, craggy\n                    and over-jutting rocks we have heretofore met with, many of which were\n                    elevated several hundred feet above our heads, and seemed to threaten\n                    us with impending danger; which was not a little magnified, in our\n                    apprehensions, from observing cast bodies of rock, which had evidently\n                    tum-bled from their lofty summits into the valleys. Had we been\n                    disposed to indulge fancy, we might have figured to ourselves, in a view\n                    of these rude mountains of rocks, many of those descriptions met with\n                    in Roman, Greek or Egyptian history, of amphitheatres, obelisks,\n                    pyramids, &amp;c. &amp;c; whilst many others exhibit-ed such regular, wavy\n                    appearences, interspersed alternately with oaks and pines, and soil of\n                    various hues, as seemed to challenge the painter with his diversified\n                    shades of coloring. And could we have observed here goats, white bears\n                    and reindeer, with now and then a human being clothed in skins and\n                    furs, and with weather a little colder, we might, perhaps, have been\n                    led to suppose ourselves in Lapland. A few settle-ments are made in\n                    this tract, which are mostly in the valleys. Deer are said to\n                    be very numerous upon these mountains-several were seen by us.

On our way we passed a place called the\n                        Great Meadows, upon the\n                    Alleghany Mountains. This place is noted\n                    for an entrenchment, cast up by General\n                        Washing-ton, then Colonel Washington, when retreating\n                    from a defeat given to a small force under his command, (near the junction\n                    of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers,) history says by a much superior body\n                    of French and Indians. We also passed over the spot where Gen. Braddock was buried. His army of 1200\n                    chosen men was de-feated near Fort Du\n                        Quesne, in an unexpected attack by the Indians. We are told\n                    that the\n                    General and half this number were killed,\n                    and sixty-four out of eighty-five of his officers; of those who\n                    escaped was Washington, at the time\n                    Aid-de-Camp to General Braddock. The\n                    de-feated army brought off their dead commander and buried him in the\n                    road, in order to elude the search of the Indians for his dead body.\n                It may be remarked that the land in the neighborhood of the Great Meadows is very level and the timber\n                    heavy, which indicates the goodness of the soil. A considerable body\n                        ofthis land was owned by Washington at the time of his death.\n                This day's journey has been very disagreeable and cold, owing to a continued\n                    fall of snow. We greatly regretted that the clouds prevented a view of\n                    the Redstone settlements from the top\n                    of Laurel Hill, this being that part of the\n                        Alle&#173;ghany Mountains from which a\n                    descent is made into the country below. From this commanding eminence\n                    the prospect, we are told, is beautiful beyond description.\n                Our disappointment, however, was in some measure recompensed by finding\n                    ourselves, when upon the top of this hill, not only above the clouds,\n                    but also so elevated in a cloud as to find the particles of snow resembling\n                    fog; a proof that large spits of snow, as they are called, ac&#173;quire\n                    their size by an accumulation of particles on their way from the clouds to\n                    the earth.

We have, therefore,\n                    no other alternative than to prosecute a long and doubtless fatiguing\n                    journey by land. This morning, whilst we were preparing to pro-eed on our route, two young men arrived at our quarters, for\n                    the purpose of accompanying us; one of them a blacksmith, and a member of\n                    our Society, the other a carpenter, and a steady young man. They are\n                    under the pay of government, and have engaged to reside in the\n                    neighborhood of Fort Wayne, to be\n                    employed for the benefit and instruction of the Indians. Previous to\n                    our leaving home, we had reason to expect that we should be overtaken\n                    by these young men, and were glad to have our expectations realized.\n                Again proceeding on our journey, we passed through Brownsville, a village on the Mononga-hela River; crossed over that river in a boat,\n                    and rode about twenty-six miles to Washington, an inland town. Our ride to-day has been\n                    through a very hilly country, tolerably rich, though badly watered. It\n                    is said that one of the first survey-ors of this tract of country, when\n                    questioned re-specting its general appearance, replied, It is like a large meadow filled with stacks of\n                        hay. A comparison very apropos.\n                It is worthy of remark, that near Brownsville, on the Monongahela, are the remains of an old fortification,\n                    including several acres of ground. Mussel shells are yet very abnndant\n                    within the intrenchment; and nearly opposite to the forti-fication are\n                    two fish pots extending quite across the river; they are made of stone,\n                    weighing gene-rally from thirty to forty pounds. It is said that the\n                    Indians who resided near the spot at the time of its discovery\n                    by the white men, had not even a traditional knowledge of the making of\n                    these fish pots, nor of the erection of the fortification. \n                This day, in passing along, my mind has been involved in much serious\n                    reflection on the im-portance of our mission. And I trust I have in no\n                    small degree felt the responsibility we are under, not to men only, but to\n                    the Great Author of all good, with an ardency not to be expressed,\n                    that we may indeed discharge the trust reposed in us, and perform the duty\n                    required of us with propriety.\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 42.0, "lon": -83.0}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 22", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "March 10, 1804", "text": "\n                10th.\n                Travelled thirty-four miles, and after night were glad to reach the house of\n                    our friendJonathan Taylor, in the State\n                    of Ohio; on our way we passed through the\n                    small villages of Tay-lorstown and\n                        West Liberty. The tract of coun-try\n                    through which we have travelled is generally fertile and is mostly settled.\n                    In the course of this day's ride, it is observable that limestone is\n                    to be found on the tops of the highest hills, but is rarely found in the\n                    bottoms.\n                It may now be noted that the hills between the Monongahela and the Ohio rivers\n                    are gene-rally of a very singular description, having two or three\n                    circular elevations, the surface of each elevation flat for the space of\n                    twenty-five to thirty feet in diameter.

On approaching it, I felt no small degree\n                    of awe.

Having been driven further and further westward, relinquished\n                    claim to tract after tract, they here made a stand, fixed in a\n                    re-solve, hitherto ye may come, but no farther! This river shall be\n                    the boundary between us! It shall limit your encroachment! The\n                    resist-ance they made, and the blood which was split, sufficiently\n                    prove the reluctance with which they gave up the contest. The bottom upon\n                    the west side of the river where we crossed, which was at the junction\n                    of Short Creek, is very rich, but not\n                    wide.

We\n                    passed through a handsome prairie containing several hundred acres called\n                    the Lower Piqua Plain, crossed Honey Creek and Lost\n                        Creek, two considerable streams of the Great Miami.\n                Thus far in our route we have been favoredwith respect to the waters, no\n                    rain having fallen lately to raise the creeks and rivers to a height\n                    sufficient to detain us. In fording some of the streams we have thought\n                    that even six inches greater depth would take our horses off their\n                    feet. There is considerable danger in fording many of the streams we\n                    have passed, from the uneveness of the stony bottoms of the rivers. The\n                    beds of the rivers are mostly limestone, and being worn smooth by the\n                    washing of the water, horses are apt to fall. This was to-day the case with\n                    my horse in fording the Miami, from which\n                    accident I got very wet. \n                During our detention here this afternoon, we observed a flock of birds\n                    alighting from the trees, different in appearance from any we\n                    had seen. Our landlord informed us they were parrots, and that they\n                    were common upon the Great Miami; and to\n                    gratify our curiosity he shot one. It was about the size of a dove, and its\n                    plumage resem-bled the green parrot of South America, the head red,\n                    and the wings tipped with the same color, the tail long and the bill and\n                    tongue of the same description as the chattering parrot. As they\n                    alighted from the trees, they made a hoarse noise resembling the chattering\n                    of the common parrot.\n                There is also a woodcock here resembling the red headed woodcock of\n                        Maryland, except that its head is\n                    black and its bill ivory.\n                At this place General Wayne erected a\n                    fortification when on his march against the In-dians, a part of which is\n                    now standing. Our landlord occupies one of the houses which was at\n                    that time built and enclosed within the stock-ade. From the late period in\n                    the day at which our supply of corn arrived for the horses, we have\n                    concluded to remain at our quarters; the landlord tells us we shall be\n                    welcome to sleep upon his floor, and has promised to make us a good\n                    fire to sleep by. \n                This is a kind of lodgment to which we have become well accustomed, having\n                    heretofore in our journey often had to wrap ourselves in our blankets\n                    and to lie upon floors, always observing the necessary precaution of laying\n                    our feet to the fire; we have in no instance taken cold.\n            \n            "}}, 0, 0, 0, {"location": {"lat": 41.044962, "lon": -85.082094}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 45", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "March 30, 1804", "text": "\n                30th.\n                Pursued our path and travelled twenty-three miles through a very fertile,\n                    heavily tim-bered and beautiful country, being a little more inclined\n                    to hills.

Their bones lie scattered\n                    upon the surface of the earth, and we are told that the route by which\n                    the army made an escape can be readily traced for the distance of five\n                    or six miles by the bones of those slain by the In-dians.\n                The grave of the Toad, nephew to the Little Turtle, a distinguished young chief, who\n                    with the Little Turtle and other chiefs\n                    visited the Friends of Baltimore two years ago, is here;\n                    he died very suddenly on his return from that jour-ney.

He inquired very particularly after\n                    his friends and acquaintance ofBaltimore, after our own welfare, the path we had come,\n                    and the difficulties we had encoun-tered on our journey through the\n                    wilderness. Having answered his questions, he replied in turn to our\n                    inquiries as follows: That since he saw us it had pleased the Great Spirit\n                    to take away two of his brothers and a nephew. That his nephew was the\n                        Toad, a young chief who was with him\n                    in Baltimore. That he died on his\n                    return from that visit, and within a few miles of home, of which\n                    circumstances he had desiredWilliam Wells\n                    to inform us. That with respect to himself, he was but half well, having\n                    been very sick last fall and expected to die. That his white brothers\n                    at Fort Wayne, hearing of his illness,\n                    sent a doctor to him who gave him physic and made him better. That he had\n                    now seen fifty-three winters, and two of his brothers being dead, made\n                    him think of death, and that his time would soon come.\n                He also told us that he had left a brother at his town who would have\n                    accompanied him, being desirous to come with him, but could not find\n                    his horse in time. After this, other conversation took place of a general\n                    nature. The interpreter informs us that his complaint is the\n                     gout, and that in the time of his illness he (the interpreter)\n                    had told him that his complaint be-longed to great folks and gentlemen.\n                        Well, said the Turtle, I always thought I was a\n                        gentlemen.* *By the suffrage of\n                        all who became acquainted with the Little\n                            Turtle during his visits to Baltimore in\n                        1801, and also in 1807, he\n                        was acknowledged to be a gentleman in character, appearance, and\n                        manners. His estimate of himself therefore was not too high. For\n                        his speech before the Indian Committee in\n                                Balti-more in\n                            1801, and other information concerning\n                        him, see appendix. T.\n                \n                About 2 o'clock we dined. At the head of the table sat the interpreter's\n                    wife, who is a modest, well-looking Indian woman, and the daughter of\n                    a distinguished chief. She had prepared for us a large well roasted wild\n                    turkey, and also a wild turkey boiled, and for these she had pro-vided\n                    a large supply of cranberry sauce. TheLittle\n                        Turtle sat at table with us, and with much sociability we\n                    all partook of an excellent dinner.\n                In the afternoon the Five Medals, attended\n                    by his sons, visited us at William Wells'\n                    house, and the opportunity being a suitable one, we proposed to them\n                    that a formal conference should then take place between us. This\n                    proposition meeting their assent, we opened the conference by desiring\n                    the interpreter to inform them that we had received their talk sent to us\n                    last fall, informing us that the implements of husbandry,\n                    which we had sent to them last year, had come to them safely, and that we\n                    had carefully ob-served all that was contained in that talk. That we\n                    were deputed by their brothers and friends ofBaltimore to come to see them. That we had accordingly\n                    come, and had with us a letter di-rected to them, which we thought ought in\n                    the first place to be read, and after that we might have something to\n                    say to them. A short pause having taken place, they expressed a desire\n                    that the letter should be read, which was accordingly done, and\n                    interpreted to them as follows:\n                \n                    \n                        From the Committee appointed for\n                                    Indian Affairs by the Friends\n                                    of Maryland to the\n                                    Little Turtle and the\n                                    Five Medals, Chiefs of the\n                                    Potto-wattamy and Miami nations of\n                            Indians:\n                        Brothers and Friends- We have received your talk, communicated by\n                            our friend William Wells, after\n                            the reception of the implements of husbandry sent last spring for\n                            your use.

The\n                            other did not omit to come for the want of love to his red\n                            brethren; family circumstances rendered it inconvenient for him to\n                            leave home. You see, brothers, that it has pleased the\n                            Great Spirit that two of us mentioned in the letter, should\n                            reach the country of our red brethren. Brothers, we thought it\n                            right in the first place to send for you, and to show you the\n                            letter which has just been read. We are glad that you are now\n                            come, and that we have this opportunity of taking you by the\n                            hand.\n                        Brothers, we believe that we have some things to say to you which\n                            are of great importance to our red brothers, to their old men, to\n                            their young men, to their women, and to their children.\n                        Brothers, we may now mention that we have not come merely to talk,\n                            but we hope we have come prepared to do a little for the welfare\n                            of our red brethren.\n                        Brothers, in looking over our business, we have thought that we\n                            should be glad to have an opportunity of seeing our red brethren\n                            together, and are willing to propose for your consideration,\n                            that you should now fix upon some place, and agree upon some time\n                            to meet us again, and that our brothers invite their old men, their\n                            young men, their women and their children to meet us, when we\n                            shall have something to say which it may not be necessary now to\n                            say.\n                        Brothers and Friends,- Should you think that the proposal which we\n                            have now made is proper, and conclude to meet us in the manner\n                            we have pointed out, we expect we shall have but little more to say\n                            at present.\n                    \n                \n                Here a pause  for some minutes took place, when the Little Turtle inquired, If\n                        the Friends had more to say. He was answered in the\n                    negative.\n                After a further pause and some conversation between the two chiefs, they\n                    rose from their seats, and perceiving that they were advancing toward\n                    us, we also arose from our seats. On meet-ing them, they took us by the\n                    hand, and with countenances indicative of great gravity, shook hands\n                    with us and returned to their seats.\n                The Five Medals then commenced a speech as\n                    follows:-\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        Brothers and Friends: My friend, the Lit-tle\n                                Turtle, and myself, together with my two sons, who\n                            are present, rejoice to have this oppor-tunity of seeing you, and\n                            of taking you by the hand.\n                        My Brothers: We are glad to be informed, that you received our talk\n                            sent to you last fall, and to find that you are now come to the\n                            country of your red brethren.\n                        My Brothers and Friends: We rejoice that the Great Spirit has\n                            conducted you safely to our country, and figure to ourselves that\n                            in you we see the rest of our brothers and friends of Balti-more, and that in taking you by\n                            the hand, we take them by the hand.\n                        Brothers: We know that you have come a long distance to see the\n                            situation of your red brethren. We have no doubt that you have\n                            things to say which are of great importance to\n                            us, and which do not belong to a few only but to many. \n                        Brothers: Your brethren the Indians do business not as the white\n                            people do. We con-vene our chiefs, and things of importance\n                            are considered by them. But, brothers, you have come to see\n                            the situation of your red brethren. It is our wish that you should\n                            see it. You shall not be disappointed. The proposal you have\n                            made to us we think right, and have concluded that this place\n                                (Fort Wayne,) is the best\n                            place to be fixed upon for the purpose you wish. We are\n                            pleased to find that you have a desire that our young men should be\n                            present to hear what you have to say, and as it is your wish to see\n                            our women and children, we desire that you may have an\n                            opportunity of seeing them.\n                        Brothers and Friends: Our young men are out hunting, and our women\n                            and children are now at work at their sugar camps. The time is\n                            not far off when they will all return to our towns, when it is\n                            usual to meet together. We hope, brothers, that you will not be in\n                            a hurry, but will allow us time to collect our people\n                            to-gether.\n                    \n                \n                Here a pause took place, when we inquired if they had any thing further to\n                    add. And being answered in the negative, we addressed them again in\n                    substance as follows:\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        Brothers and Friends: When we left our  homes, we knew\n                            it was early in the season, and expected that we should ge to the\n                            country of our red brethren at a time when their young men,\n                            their women and children would be busy. But brothers, a part of the\n                            service* *The Friends were desirous that their\n                                agricul-turist, Philip\n                                Dennis, should arrive amongst the Indians in time to\n                                plant corn. T. which we de-sign to render to you,\n                            required that we should come early, and makes it also necessary\n                            that we should now be in a hurry.\n                        Brothers: We will also add that when we were chosen by our friends\n                            at home to pay a visit to our red brethren, our women and\n                            chil-dren consented that we should leave them, but charged us\n                            that we should not stay away from them longer than circumstances\n                            really required. A long time has already past since we left\n                            them, we therefore hope, brothers, that in three or four days\n                            it will be in your power to get together some of your people. Those\n                            that are far from home we do not wish that you should send for.\n                    \n                \n                The Little Turtle then observed that the\n                    res-sons we had given were good. The Five\n                        Medals next remarked that at the time proposed, they\n                    could easily convene a considerable number of their indolent people, who\n                    were too lazy to hunt or make sugar, but such they did not wish us to\n                    see. Their industrious young men and women \n                    were too far from home to be convened in so short a time.\n                Here a short conversation took place between the chiefs, and afterwards they\n                    proposed seven day's hence as the time; desiring that to-morrow might\n                    not be counted, as it would take them a day to return home. To this we\n                    consented.\n                The Five Medals then expressed as follows:\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        Brothers, it would have been very desirable to us if you could have\n                            met us at the time of our counsel. We have very often told our\n                            people of the Quakers. They listen to us, but are at a loss to\n                            know what sort of people the Quakers are. If you could stay,\n                            brothers, they would have an opportunity of seeing the Quakers,\n                            and of hearing words from your own mouths.\n                    \n                \n                After this the Little Turtle added:\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        Brothers: We hope the words that you may say to us at the time we\n                            have appointed to meet will be upon paper. From that paper we\n                            can at some future time have your words de-livered to our people.\n                            This, brothers, will in some measure answer the end.\n                    \n                \n                During a pause which occupied several minutes we asked them if we understood\n                    each other. The Turtle replied, Yes, perfectly; we have nothing further to do now than to\n                        look for-ward to the day appointed.\n                After this we took each other by the hand and very cordially bade farewell.\n                    We then re-turned to our lodgings.\n                \n                In the evening we again had the company of the chiefs, they having been\n                    invited by our landlord to take supper with us.\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 41.044962, "lon": -85.082094}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 52", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "April 03, 1804", "text": "\n                3d.\n                This day rainy, and spent chiefly atWilliam\n                        Wells'.\n                Besides the garrison stationed here, there is a large store of goods\n                    established by the United States, for the purpose of suppplying the\n                    Indians.

On our\n                    way we passed several sugar camps, at which were Indian women and children\n                    who were em-ployed in making sugar. Their huts were large,\n                    and covered with the bark of the Buck Eye wood. Their troughs for catching\n                    the sugar water as it is called, are made of the bark of the red elm,\n                    they are made thin, and the ends tied together. We were shown the places\n                    where stood the houses of several distinguished char-acters amongst\n                    the Indians. Captain Wells also took us\n                    to the ground, where the Little Turtle\n                    reviewed his men, and gave them their orders before going against the army\n                    of General St. Clair. It is an extensive\n                    plain near the river.Wells was then one\n                    of the number, and says theLittle Turtle\n                    had one thousand four hundred men; St.\n                        Clair's army consisted of a much larger number, and were\n                    about fifty miles distant at the time. The Little\n                        Turtle divided his men into bands or messes, to each mess\n                    twenty men. It was the business of four of this number alter-nately to\n                    hunt for provisions. At 12 o'clock each day it was the duty of the hunters\n                    to re-turn to the army with what they had killed. By this regulation,\n                    his warriors were well supplied with provisions, during the seven day's in\n                    which they were advancing from this place to the field of battle. It\n                    is well known that at day break the Indians commenced an unexpected\n                    attack upon St. Clair's forces, killed\n                    nine hundred of his men, and put his whole army to flight.Wells says, that only about thirty Indians were\n                    killed in the battle, and that about twenty died  afterwards of\n                    their wounds. He also related the following anecdote:\n                A considerable altercation arose amongst the Indians on the review ground,\n                    relative to a Commander-in-Chief. Some were in favor of\n                    Buckangehelas, a principal chief amongst the\n                    Delawares, whilst others were in favor of the\n                    Little Turtle. At length Buckangehelas himself decided the controversy\n                    by yielding to the Little Turtle, saying\n                    that he was the youngest and most active man, and that he preferred him to\n                    him-self. This reconciled the parties, and the Little Turtle took the command.\n                We also rode to view a prairie which extends from the St. Mary's river to the Little\n                        river, a branch of the Wabash. The distance from one to the other is not more than\n                    four miles, and the highest ground is not more than five feet above\n                    the water in either river. The Indians say that in high freshets they have\n                    passed from one water to the other in their canoes. A canal might\n                    easily be cut here, and at a small expense, by which the waters of the\n                    lakes and the waters of the Ohio, (and of\n                    course the Mississippi) would be\n                    connected. An abundance of furs and skins taken on the waters of the\n                        Ohio and the Wabash, are brought up the latter river in boats by the\n                    Canadians and the Indians, and thence taken across a portage of eight miles\n                    to the Miami of the Lakes,* *The Maumee river.\n                    whence they are\n                     again conveyed by water to Detroit; goods suit-able for the Indian trade are also\n                    transported back again by the same route.\n                After spending some time in viewing the re-mains of several old Indian\n                    towns, graves, hiero-glyphics, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., we returned to\n                        William Wells' house, where we dined,\n                    and in the even-ing returned to our lodgings.\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 41.044962, "lon": -85.082094}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 65", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "April 08, 1804", "text": "\n                8th.\n                Paid a visit to the carpenter and black-smith who accompanied us as before\n                    mentioned.

The\n                    land is generally under cultivation, and is tolerably improved.
