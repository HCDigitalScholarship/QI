This morning, set out for Bro-thertown, having the Chief's horse to ride, with                    one of their principal men for a guide. We travelled through a most                    fertile country, over logs, and thro' bushes, at the rate of about a mile,                    and sometimes two, in an hour. Arrived at Brothertown in the evening, and were treated with all the                    kindness we could ask. Having comfortably lodged here one night, the                    next day we set out for Fort Schuyler,                    being still accommodated with horses and a guide. The roads were beyond                    description, bad; but we were favoured to reach Fort                        Schuyler, in the even- ing,&#8212;having previously agreed to                    meet our family of female Indians at this place.

Run aground by means of a strong wind from the                    western shore, about                      nine miles above New York. When the tide                    was in favour, we carried out our anchor, but all endeavours at this                    time, proved in vain; and we were obliged to remain in the cold, until the                    tide should rise again. In the evening, we renewed our efforts, and                    were favoured to effect our design. We arrived opposite New York about                    nine o'clock in the evening, but the tide run so strong that the captain                    said he could not bring the vessel to shore. Being desirous of mo-                    ving forward as fast as practicable, we engaged the boat to take us ashore;                    which being covered with ice on every part, and tossing so much, that it                    was with difficulty we could get in. At length we arrived safely in                    New York, and were kindly received by our friend Edmund Pryor; and may truly say, from the tenderness that                    was shown to us, and to the In- dian girls, it was \" like a brook by the                    way.\"             "}}, {"location": {"lat": 42.735912, "lon": -73.561504}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 379", "url": "/ststic/img/SW_JC1797_Page_13.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "November 17, 1797", "text": " A snowy morning. Friends manifested much kindness towards us, particularly                        Joseph De-laplaine, who accompanied                    us to the vessel, and pre-sented to each of the girls a piece of silver. We                    ar- rived safely at Brunswick about                    seven o'clock in the evening. There was here, at this time, a certain                    great man from Poland, who had never seen an In- dian, and was desirous of                    being introduced to the girls. They being in a private room at supper,                    he walked in to take a view of them. When he beheld their orderly                    deportment, he seemed much surpri- sed; and after walking round the table                    where they were sitting, he said, These are almost                        civilized already. I informed him that the father of one of                    them would not drink wine.                  The same evening, the Poland general and his company came into the room,                    where my companion                                         and I were sitting. In the course of the                    conversa- tion, the word thou was used, which attracted the attention                    of a young man, who remarked in French to the general, that we, as a                    people, had a very un- couth way of speaking thou; &#8212; he apprehended, as                    I suppose, that we should not understand what he said in that                    language. However, I informed him, that it was the language of the Almighty                    to the first man, Adam; therefore bid him not reflect upon the people                    for using the language, which the Lord had taught them. He looked confused;                    and the Polander, who understood English, appeared to favour the ob-                    servation.

Passing on, we arrived safely at Bristol in Pennsylvania, where we parted. Henry took charge of the children, and went to                    his home in that neighbourhood, where it was concluded the girls should                    remain until I should return from Philadelphia. Accordingly I took pas- sage in the stage,                    and reached home about nine o'clock in the evening; where, through the                    favour of a kind, preserving Providence, I found my fami-ly well, and                    we were mutually rejoiced to see each other.
