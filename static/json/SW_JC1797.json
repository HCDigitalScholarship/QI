Run aground by means of a strong wind from the\n                    western shore, about \n                     nine miles above New York.

They being in a private room at supper,\n                    he walked in to take a view of them. When he beheld their orderly\n                    deportment, he seemed much surpri- sed; and after walking round the table\n                    where they were sitting, he said, These are almost\n                        civilized already. I informed him that the father of one of\n                    them would not drink wine. \n                 The same evening, the Poland general and his company came into the room,\n                    where my companion\n                    \n                     and I were sitting. In the course of the\n                    conversa- tion, the word thou was used, which attracted the attention\n                    of a young man, who remarked in French to the general, that we, as a\n                    people, had a very un- couth way of speaking thou; &#8212; he apprehended, as\n                    I suppose, that we should not understand what he said in that\n                    language. However, I informed him, that it was the language of the Almighty\n                    to the first man, Adam; therefore bid him not reflect upon the people\n                    for using the language, which the Lord had taught them.
