their great Load, abundance\n                    of which was beautiful Chesnut, the finest I reme remember\n                    to have seen, with a large Quan- -tity of Oak of various kinds, some\n                    Sugar Maple &amp;c: much of this stage the road was very Rocky and\n                    Stony. From thence to Conalds&#8212; -Ville a\n                    small Town on the Yoxhiogeny 14 miles the\n                    most of this stage was poor, rough, and Mountainous, and but thinly\n                    settled, except within 3 or 4 miles of the River after we left the Chesnut\n                        Ridge. &#8212; We all took notice when on the Allegenies and for many Miles on this side, how\n                    very backward the Trees were, when we left home they were putting out\n                    fast, and the Weather being very warm they made rapid progress; yet this\n                    morning we remarked the buds of the Chesnut and White Oak were not\n                    formed into leaves so as to make an appearance, yet the same day as we\n                    descended from the Chesnut Ridge the Trees\n                    were all green, the sight was so Curious, and different from our late\n                    pros- -pect, that I measured some Chesnutt leaves and found them to be\n                    3 Inches wide, and Six long, and sprouts of 8 or 9 Inches growth. So\n                    that I think there is at least, in three miles \n                     Riding two Weeks difference in the\n                    Season. When on the Chesnut hill there is one of the most extensive\n                    prospects that is to be met with in traveling, both to the North, to\n                    the West, and to the South, I had no doubt but the View was of 50\n                    miles extent, it was not so de- lightful as some I have seen, for want of\n                    a lofty mountain rising 10 or more miles in front, but it was\n                    Chequered with many Plan- -tations: in every direction, the View look\n                    -ed like an extensive plain, but when we came to the traverse it, we found\n                    many Steep Hills, but tho no Mountain; neither is there any\n                    to the Westward in the United States equal to those we have Crossed.\n                    We lodged with our kind friend Thomas\n                        Gibson on the Bank of the River. 41 miles\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 40.022106, "lon": -79.88}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 13", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "May 07, 1798", "text": "\n                7th\n                    \n                 a pleasant day, went to my Kinsman&#8217;s\n                    Reese Cadwaladers, near BrownsVille on the Monongahala, we Crossed the Yoxge\n                    Yoxhiogeny in a boat it was about 6 feet\n                    deep and perhaps 150 yards wide, in about half a mile after we crossed the\n                    River, we passed by a Merchant Mill erected on a very Curious Seat,\n                    the stream was small, but had a natural perpendicular fall over \n                     a broad Rock which lay Horizontal\n                    of 28 feet, the Mill was erected close to this Rock which formed a\n                    level Yard to the upper Road; under sd Rock was a Cavity or hollow\n                    place 12 feet high, and nearly as far back, which ran all across the\n                    Stream, over which the Water beautifully descended.

It was two O&#8217;clock when we arrived\n                    here, and sometime after the above Conference, Cornplanter came into our apartment, and asked us if we\n                    could eat in the Indian way, we informed him we ex- -pected we could,\n                        and he presently we had some\n                    Dinner brought in some dinner in a bark bowl, and a Tin kettle,\n                    the bowl was placed on the seat beside us, and the kettle on the\n                    ground before us, and we were invited to eat, we saw the bowl, and the\n                    kettle, but what was in either of them we knew not, or whether they\n                    were to be eaten together, or separate, the bowl contained a number of\n                    round lumps of something tied in Cornhu -husks, two dumplings\n                    were tyed in one set of husks, with a string at each end and in the\n                    middle, we let them know that our Ignorance was such, we did not know\n                    how to begin, which set some of the younger sort \n                     a laughing, but the Chief took out\n                    his knife, for they had set neither knives, forks, or spoons, and taking up\n                    the Dumplins he cut one of them in too, then striping up the\n                    Cornhusks, with\n                    his knife he cut off a piece of the dump -lin, and\n                        and\n                    which diped it it in the Kettle, which we found\n                        after contained Bears Oyl, and eat it, we followed the\n                    example, and made a light meal, the Bears Oyl was Cold and not\n                    grateful to our Pallates, but we have\n                    seen since, seen this way of eating is often prac- -ticed among\n                    them; the Cold Indian Bread dipped in the Oyl is more frequently used.\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 41.837781, "lon": -79.003006}, "media": {"caption": "Pages: 39, 40, 41", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "May 18, 1798", "text": "\n                18\n                \n                 Last evening after we had lain down to rest, Cornplanter and his son Henry came into our apartment , and informed\n                    let us know he would like to know what we intended to\n                    say to his people in Council, we informed told him we would\n                    give him an Opportunity of information &gt;him in the\n                    Morning, which this morning we complied with, we and let him\n                    know we could not tell all what that we should say, for we\n                    be- -lieved on such occasions it was right to wait on the good spirit\n                    to be directed.

You\n                            never wished our lands, you never wished any part of our Lands,\n                            therefore we are determined to try to learn your ways, and\n                            those young men may stay here two years to try, by that time we\n                            shall know whether Morris will leave us any land, for last\n                            summer we sold our Land, and we dont know yet whether we shall\n                            get what we reserved, or wether we shall get our Money, but by\n                            that time we shall know, and then if they like it, and we like\n                            it, your young men may stay longer. Brothers, if your\n                            young Men stay here we want them to lern our Children to read\n                            and Write.

also if\n                    the Indians where to clear land and fence lots, they would not belong\n                    to the Nati- -on. this consideration made us believe it would be best\n                    to look elsewhere. &#8211;  The Nation owns 42 Square miles on this \n                    \n                    River, beginning at the Pennsylvania Line, the lines of the reservation is\n                    not yet Run, but we found the Indians have a choice that it should ly on the\n                    River, half a mile wide on each side.\n                    about 9 miles from hence up the River lat-\n                    -terly stood a Town called Genesinguh-\n                        -ta, the Inhabitants of which Village a few years since\n                    mostly removed here, about 10 miles further up the River we understood a settlement had latterly been\n                    made, from the best information we could get, thought somewhere a-\n                    -bout the Old Town would be the most\n                    suitable place to fix on, it being about half way between the upper\n                    settlement and lower Town, according with consider- -able exertion\n                    about 9 OClock we got Cornplan- -ter, his\n                    son Henry, and three other Indians to\n                    embark with us five in a Canoe, they put us up the River with setting Poles at the Rate of 3 miles an\n                    hour. in places the River was Shallow\n                    and ran rapid, in other places from two to six feet deep, we pased by\n                    a num- -ber of Islands, some pretty large, which appeared rich, were\n                    grown over with grass and other herbage very luxuriant, the \n                     flats on each side of the River appeared much of the same quality, tho\n                    none of them\n                    appeared were wide; in about 6 miles we came to Cornplanters sawmill, we stop- -ed at his\n                    request and viewed it, the Mill is almost new, built on a Small\n                    Stream, which when we were there was so low that the Mill could do\n                    very little work, and at the time of Year that the Stream\n                    is pretty full, the River is often so high\n                    that it hurts the mill with its backwater, in about three miles fur-\n                    -ther up the River we came to the Old Town, three or more families yet re-\n                    -main here, we thought there might be 150 or more acres of a flat that has\n                    been mostly cleared and worked with Corn, part of which is grown up\n                    with Hazels &amp;c and part with grass, that in a few wee\n                    weeks would do to mow, and some of the richest sorts of it are put in\n                    with Corn this Spring; it doth not appear to have ever been fenced,\n                    and at certain stretches it is mostly subject to an overflow.\n                    it the tract lies on the Northwest side of the River. the flat is about 40 reaches wide, and then \n                     commences Timber Land, mostly White\n                    Pine, suitable for building, or Railtim- -ber, which Timberland within 60\n                    perch- -es of the flat we thought pretty good, lies very well to the\n                    sun, with a gentle Assent, and clear of stones; when Viewing this\n                    land, and taking its local situation in -to consideration, we were united\n                    in believing, that somewhere about near this place would be\n                    best to make our settlement; upon informing two of the Chiefs who bore\n                    us company, that we thought across the upper end of the cleared flat\n                    from the River back, taking in part of the\n                    Wood- -land, would be suitable for our purpose, and that if they liked\n                    it, to tell us, and if the did not like it, tell us so, and we would look\n                    farther where it would suit them better, they said the had informed us\n                        that all their Land was be- -fore us and that we might take\n                    it where we liked it best, and expressed their full\n                    satisfaction with our choice, Cornplanter\n                    then said, this man, meaning one of the Chiefs that was with us, lives\n                    in this Town, and he is like one of\n                    us, he you, a sober man, &amp;

We informed the Chiefs that our Young\n                    men would want timber for \n                     to build a House, for Rails, and for\n                    fire- -Wood, to which they readily consented, say- -ing, they would be\n                    very glad they would cut all the Trees down, and further Liberty they\n                    would give them, if they saw a Buck swimming across the River, or\n                    running through the Woods they might shoot him or if they saw any fish\n                    in the River they might cath catch them, we then returned\n                    down the River with Cornplanter to his Village\n                \n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 41.837781, "lon": -79.003006}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 52", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "May 22, 1798", "text": "\n                22\n                \n                 This Morning resumed the consideration of what farther pro- -positions we\n                    should make to these people in order to their additional encourag-\n                    -ment in Civilization and Aggreculture, and mutually agreed upon some,\n                    which will be inserted in their proper place. &#8211;-\n                 This afternoon Cornplanter presented us\n                    with several kinds of seed Corn suitable for this Climet; divers kinds of\n                    beans, and Garden seeds, such as Watermelons, Pump- -kins, Cucumbers\n                    &amp;c with a quantity of Potatoes for to Plant, these he said had\n                    been sent in from the different houses as a blessing to begin with, we\n                    thought the hearty good will with which these were presented\n                    manifested a full approba- -tion with our undertaking, there were more\n                    of each sort, except potatoes than we \n                     wanted to plant, and upon informing\n                    him so we were answered, that we must take them all, for they were\n                    sent in for that purpose. \n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 41.837781, "lon": -79.003006}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 68", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "May 23, 1798", "text": "\n                23\n                    \n                 We are now our own Cooks, dishwashers &amp;c Lining on our provisions that\n                    we brought with us from Pittsburgh and\n                        Franklin, Cornplanter\n                    ear-\n                    ly informed us early after our arrival how that they\n                    were scarce of Corn, occationed as he said by an uncommon overflow of the\n                    River last Spring, sometime after their\n                    Corn was come up, and by an early Frost in the Fall.

The Chief gave us\n                    some Sugar, and some we purchased of the Indians at 1/6 Per Lb. we have a\n                    pret- -ty Comfortable House much to ourselves, Corn- -planter has two Houses they stand about 10 feet\n                    apart, tho Roofed over between as the o other parts of the House\n                    which is with Bark, this Space between the Houses serves for an entry,\n                    and a place to pound their Corn under put their Wood &amp;c. out\n                    of this entry a door opens into each apart\n                    \n                     apartment, that asigned us 30 feet\n                    long, the other 24, and each 16 feet wide. they are built of Round Logs, or\n                    Poles, let in close together, the net Chunked or plaistered, so that\n                    we found our end pretty open and cold enough before morning, upon our\n                    informing the Chief they had better make their Houses titeer,\n                    plaistering up the Cracks, he replyed if they made their Houses too\n                    warm, they would not like to leave them when Winter came to go a\n                    hunting. along each side of these Houses, from the door to the\n                    opposite end, ran Births, or Seats, they were about four feet wide and\n                    one foot high, they were covered with Boards, and on these Deer- skins\n                    were spread, and these were their Beds, they also make a pretty good\n                    Seat, and are always ready, over these Births, about five feet high,\n                    are Shelves of the same width of those the births\n                        beneath, which serve to put \n                     their Kitchen furniture, Corn &amp;c\n                    upon, the fire is built on the ground in the Middle of the House, this\n                    part between the births not being floored; there is a large hole left\n                    in the Top of the Roof for the Smoke to go out at, which hole makes a\n                    pretty good Window. -&#8211; As far as I have observed the above descrip-\n                    -tion answers for most of their Houses, tho they are not so large, nor\n                    double, like this, they are mostly from 12 to 15 feet Square, with a\n                    shed before the door, there are perhaps 30 such houses in this Village and a number more down the River out of Sight, and some above, the\n                    Houses are beautifully situated on the West side of the River, which is about 150 Yards wide and\n                    glides along by the town with a gentle\n                    current. the bank of the River is low, tho\n                    gra- -dually asscends to there Houses, which are mostly within 6 or 7\n                    pearchs so that they readily supply themselves with Water \n                     there being no springs on the flat\n                    where the Town stands, which flat is a\n                    Sandy loam, easily tilled , and if well managed would be very\n                    productive. there are 50 or 60 Acres of Land adjoining the Town nearly cleared, the most of\n                        this which is put in Yearly with Corn, Beans, and\n                    Potatoes. the Work is all done by the Women with Hoes, they were very\n                    busy while we were here, much of the Land was grown up with Grass,\n                    with Weeds &amp;c, they go round the Old Cornhills, which were very high,\n                    as I have observed it is the general practice to have a hill when\n                    finished near one foot high, and hoe the grass and weeds clean away,\n                    then dig a hole where the hill stood and plant in the same place, and\n                    sometime after the Corn comes up, the hoe all the face of the ground\n                    over, so that it looked very neat. they plant beans with their Corn, also\n                    a large quantity that they stick poles for, they also plant Squashes\n                    and Pumpkins among their corn - The Women since we came here worked\n                    hard, they found all their Corn, for homi- -ny, and for Bread, sift and\n                    prepare it, Cut and Split all their Wood, and Carry it home on their\n                    backs near a Quarter of \n                     a Mile, make all there fires, and\n                    all other Kitchen Business, plant and take care of their corn, and\n                    gather it when ready, Plant their Beans and stick them, and as far as\n                    I can learn all other out doors work, except building their houses and\n                    Splitting the Rails that the Corn Land is enclosed with. It has been a\n                    busy time since we came here, the Wo- -men have rose early, gone out\n                    with their hoes to the Cornfield 4 or 5 in a Company, some of whom\n                    where Old Gray Headed Women, and some young ones of 8, 10, or 12 Years\n                    of age, stuck pretty Close to their Work, returned in the even- -ing\n                    weary, and go early to Bed. one old Gray Headed Woman I have seen\n                    steadily on the move, she has had both her feet so froze that she goes\n                    altogether on her knees, I have seen her carrying in wood and making\n                    the fire, going to the Ri- -ver and\n                    Bringing up water, I have seen take her hoe and go 40 pearches out to \n                     the Cornfield, and return in the\n                    Even- -ing with the Labourers, and put her hoe by, and all this while\n                    the Men are spending their time in Idleness, such as shooting with\n                    their bows and Arrows at a mark which is a very great recreation\n                    with them, pitching of Queats, Jumping, playing at some kind of\n                    Games, and on Musical Instruments, and loitering about so that I have\n                    not while in this Village seen either\n                    Man or Boy at any kind of Work, to se little Girls, and Old Women\n                    working hard with the hoe, and boys of 12, 14, or 16 just by them all\n                    day a playing, looked unnatural, hard, and to me very grevi- -ous. The\n                    Men at seasons go a hunting, and at times a Fishing, and they Work the\n                    Canoe, at which they are very handy, there is very little game of any\n                    kind at this season of the year brought in, I have seen but one deer\n                    all the time we were among them and, I have seen no kind of any small\n                    Game, except the Turkey heretofore noted. the Catch a few fish, yet but\n                    little was done at it while we were there, \n                     so that they live poor, their chief\n                    subsistence at this season was Corn, beans, and Bears Oyl, in\n                    different preparations, much of their Corn and Beans, were pounded into an\n                    ho- -miny, and Boiled, this I thought was their Chief dependence, they\n                    also pound Corn and Beans in to a flour, and make bread of it, they\n                    also boyl it in dumplins, which they eat with Bear Oyl by dipping it\n                    in, as they do also with their Bread, they\n                    also sometimes put Oyl in there ho- -miny, they also\n                    at times puts sugar in it, with which it eats very well, but from my\n                    observation they eat much less than than we do, a small piece of\n                    Bread or dum- -plin dipped in the Oyl seemed to satisfy nature, and\n                    there seated meals I thought were not more than two a day about 10 or\n                    11 OClock, and in the Evening, if any of their friends came to see them,\n                    the Visit was not interrupted with Cookery, or much Cerimony in laying\n                    the table &amp;c. if their hominy was boiled, which was generally the case\n                    af- -ter 11 OClock, the day through, and it was not material whether\n                    Cold or Warm, and some of their acquaintance came in, the \n                     Births always made a seat ready,\n                    wheren they were presently engaged in smoak- -ing and talking, and\n                    while thus busily employed, a kettle of hominy with a large Wooden\n                    spoon, is brought and set down on the Ground before them, he that is\n                    most handy to it lays by his Pipe, and in a few minutes appears to be\n                    satisfyed with his repast, and moves it on to the next, while the rest of\n                    the Company are engaged as if no Victuals were near them, thus the\n                    Kettle passes th through the Company in a little time, and\n                    when done with, hung up, until some -body else comes in, if they have\n                    no hominy, the Bread, or dumplin, goes round in like manner; there is\n                    no trouble of laying, or clearing the ta- -ble, or placing of Chairs,\n                    Wiping the knives and Forks, or Changing of plates, but in a simple\n                    and easy manner all that cerimony is avoided. \n                 In their Cloathing and Dress their turn is for something tawdry; such as a\n                    gay hand- -kerchief, Calico shirt, Scarlet Leggons, Blue Coat, or\n                    petticoat, a belt of lively\n                    coo colours \n                     decorated with Beads tyed round their\n                    mid- -dles, or knees, with long ends hanging down, the are very fond\n                    of trinkets of various kinds in there noses, and Ears, the Men more\n                    particularly. I have seen bobs of various kinds hanging there noses to\n                    the weight of an Ounce, or more, coming down over their Mouth. the\n                    Warriors have the rim of their Ears cut round, and loaded with\n                    different kinds of Toys, until the hang down several Inches. I saw one\n                    man with two padlocks in one Year, such as are used for Saddle- bags,\n                    another with a Watch, such as Children use. large silver Crosses are\n                    also made use of. their Calico shirts are short and &amp; have\n                    ruffles to their sleeves &amp; Bosoms. the Men and Womens are both\n                    made in the same form, they come a little lower than their Hips, and\n                    hangs loose at the lower end, the Women wearing their\n                    Petticuts Petticoats over under them, which\n                    petticoats are mostly made of blue Cloath, without any needlework,\n                    exept the stitching some red Worsted binding \n                     on about 9 Inches of the upper part;\n                    their way of making and putting them on is, to take a piece of Cloath\n                    perhaps 1&#189; Yards long turn down the upper part as above described,\n                    which part is spread over with Ribbons, then Wrap it tite round them,\n                    and tye it with a string, their shift as mentioned, hanging the out\n                    side, such who suckle lift up their Shirts for the Child to get at the\n                    pap, which Conduct to those who are unacquainted with it may look\n                    immodest, but it is not the case, for a Child is so suckled, and less of\n                    the Mothers skin shown than is customa- -ry among our farmers Wives,\n                    -\n                 With all their tawdry and liveliness in dress the go dirty, I thought the\n                    Women more particularly so than the Men, per- -haps from their working\n                    harder, and being more among the grease, some of their shirts don&#8217;t\n                    appear to be ever Washed, and about their Sholders the become very\n                    black and greesy, from their greesy heads; their hair I have observed to\n                    be the Cloath to wipe their greasy fingers \n                     in, while eating their bread and\n                    Oyl. thus for want of a change of Cloaths, and living in their dirt,\n                    they become very lowsy, which they try to extrecate them\n                    -selves from, by pulling of their shifts, turning them inside\n                        outwards, and hunting the Vermon with as much com-\n                    -possure, and seemingly good grace, as a Mother amongst us would do, in\n                     combing one of her Children, and this part of their dirt has not been\n                    one of the least of our trials, neither have we any expectation of\n                    leaving them, without carrying away some breeders. \n                 For more than two weeks past the weather has been very dry, part of the\n                    time a Cold north wind, we had frost for ten Mornings successively,\n                    during which time we slept in open Cabins, in our blankets, so that we\n                    sensible felt the want of more cover- -ing, and a better Bed before\n                    morning. for two or three days past the weather has been warm, with a\n                    strong South wind. the Woods has been much on fire dur- -ing this dry\n                    weather, Clouds of smoke \n                     have frequently covered us, so that\n                    the Sun has been hid. A curious Sight present- -ed two nights ago, of\n                    some neighbouring Hills or rather mountains that were on fire, perhaps\n                    the had not been burnt for seve- -ral Years, and the great quantity of\n                    dead timber, both standing and laying down, having taken fire as it\n                    passed along,\n                    which made a very lively appearance in the night, looking as if\n                    the whole Mountain was on fire. &#8211; We have been under some exercise for\n                    a few days past concern- -ing our goods, which are coming up the\n                        River, we have ing\n                    very little cause to expect their arrival before the last of this\n                    Month, and the dry weather has been such for some time past, that the\n                    River has fallen very fast, which the\n                    Indians remarked to us with some degree of seriousness, saying that it\n                    would be with difficulty the Boat could be ~ brought up some Shallow\n                    places, but in the midst of our trials we have still been favoured; a\n                    considerable quantity of rain fell last Evening, tho no diffi- -rence\n                    yet appears in the River, there \n                     is some reason to hope it will rise.\n                 We intended to have set of this Morning by Eight OClock for Genesinguhta, and and agreed with\n                        Henry Obeal last evening to go with\n                    us, and be our en- -terpretter; it is now eleven OClock, yet nei-\n                    -ther he, nor his Fathers family have got their breakfast, tho we have been\n                    hurry- -ing him for two hours past, about 12 two of us set of on horse\n                    back, the other three having started an hour sooner with one Indian in\n                    a Canoe; we rode the\n                    River one mile above the Town, and went up the Eastside of it, to said\n                            Town our first 3 or 4\n                    miles was through an Open bot- -tom, thinly timbered, and good riding,\n                    then passed through thick Timber, a large quan- -tity of which were\n                    Sugar Maple, thence through a thick Forrest of Hemlock, and pine, very\n                    difficult to pass, to the shore opposite the place of destination; here\n                    we again rode the River tho wide and\n                    deep, we stoped at the House of a Chief who went with us to our inten ded\n                    Settlement, here we met with our friends who went \n                     in the Canoe. We viewed an Empty\n                    house that on stood near our Settlement, we but\n                    not liking it, we proceeded to ano- -ther that was on it said\n                    settlement wherein a family lived, we understood they proposed leaving\n                    it, and would sell their right, upon conferring with the Woman, who we\n                    understood was the owner of the house, she was willing to part with\n                    the house but having put in a few spots with Corn and Vines, the whole\n                    not more than 3 or 4 pearch Square, she was appeared\n                    unwilling to relinquish them, and they were so in our way, that we thought\n                    we had better look elsewhere for a settlement, but upon the Chiefs\n                    conferring with her, she was willing to part with each of the spots\n                    except one which was not much in our way, and we understanding she was\n                    a sober Woman that would be likely to make good use of the Money, we paid\n                    her 20 dollars for her house and previligdges, and with our assistance\n                    she removed out and in less than an hour we had possission \n                     our young men gave it the\n                    house a thorough cleaning, and before dark our scanty furniture was\n                    arranged for House-keeping, and having supped on our preparations, which\n                    admitted of but little change, we prepared for bed in our open house,\n                    and naked Walls, the Indi- -an Chief at our request sent us three\n                    deerskins with the hair on, which which we placed for our\n                    Conveniency, and re- -tired, but we sensibly felt before morn- -ing\n                    the want of a better bed and more Clothes. the night being cold we were\n                    under the necessity of rising several times to re- -new our fire.

from the Seashore where our forefathers once liv- -ed:\n                            the White People have cheated us, and got our land from us, and now \n                             we have but little left, we will\n                            try to learn your way.\n                         Brothers, you know there are some bad People amongst us, and you\n                            know we have been cheated, and that makes us bad, and our\n                            Minds uneasy; if we had not been cheated we should have been\n                            very rich People, and had plen- -ty of every thing, and then our\n                            Minds would be easy, and we could think on the good\n                            Spirit.\n                         Brothers, the reason I mention to you a- -bout our being Cheated,\n                            some of my War- -riors wont mind what I say unto them; but\n                            will have their own way, because they know I often have been\n                            Cheated by the White People; If I had never been cheated, then\n                            my Warriors would believe me, and mind what I say to them, but\n                            now they wont mind.\n                         Brothers, we cant all go to work at once some of my Warriors will\n                            go a hunting to get Provisions, and sometimes they broke \n                             a Gun, and then it takes a great\n                            deal of money to get a new one, we have very few Hoes, and\n                            Axes, and such things amon- -gst us, and we are not able to get\n                            them.\n                         Brothers, I will go along with you to Canan\n                                darque, and there we will get matters settled about\n                            the Mill, and bring it back to your young men in Writing.\n                         Brothers, this is all I have now got to say we will now\n                            Shake hands.\n                    \n                \n\n                 At the close of this speech we expressed a few words more, representing\n                    among other things the un- -reasonableness of their present practice,\n                    of their Mothers, Wives, and Sisters, working all day in the fields,\n                    and in the Woods, with their hoes, and axes, whilst they themselves\n                    were at the same time playing with their Bows and Arrows &amp;c\n                    recommending to them to begin our way by early setting their boys to\n                    business, taking them out to how Corn &amp;c thus by early habitting them\n                    to Work, their Minds will be turned to it, business will become\n                    familier, and they will not think hard of it. and as they expressed the\n                    White People were rich and had plenty, we let them \n                     know it was by industry it Was\n                    obtained the men doing their share of business in the fields, &amp;c\n                    thereby leaving the Wo- -men more time to attend to spinning, sewing,\n                    darying &amp;c in the house.\n                 We concluded with seriously impressing on their Minds the remembrance,\n                    that it was from the good Spirit they re- -cieved every good thing,\n                    and that he could hear every good Word they said, and see every thing\n                    they did, and if they were good, and industerous, this good Spirit\n                    would love them, and bless them with many good things. In a few\n                    minutes after we had concluded, and informed them we had done,\n                        Cornplanter Observed, now all things\n                    were done, and settled, we will cover up the Council fire.\n                 We had no provision of our own here, therefore concluded to stay and dine\n                    with the Chief, about five Oclock we had a loaf of

from what it proceeded, where we saw a Man in a frightful\n                    Dress, we then walked out more fully to view the sight, where we saw\n                    two Men with naked Arms, Thighs, and legs, they had Bearskins on their\n                    backs \n                     which hung down below their hips,\n                    and tyed together across their breasts, and on their head\n                    they had a grim and Terrible appearance, this false face, for so it\n                    was called, was made as frightfull as nature could invent, the hair on\n                    its head hang- -ing forward and over the face; the Mouth gr\n                    grinning, large, and much aside; the nose, and Cheeks Wrinkled and\n                    very Huge; the Eyes set around with tin to re- -semble the uncommon\n                    stearing, and the whole face painted red and black, each of these Men\n                    had in their hands a stick of about 8 Inches in length fastened to a\n                     shell of a Water Tortise, the which Shells had some small\n                    stones or other hand substances in them, which made a great

The Town and\n                    pasture land was enclosed in a lot of perhaps 12 or more acres which\n                    look -ed Clean and pretty, having very good pasture in the enclosure,\n                    where were several horses, Cows and and swine. their houses\n                    looked pretty snug, perhaps 18 or 20 in number; their Corn land was\n                    down towards the River, the plant it\n                    without any inclosure, keeping their stock in the lot. The house we went\n                    into had a large quantity of Corn hanging up in it, considerably more\n                    than I saw all the time I was at allegeny,\n                    and upon enquiring, we understood they sell many bushels every year to\n                    the White People, their Vicinity to\n                    lake Erie, makes it easy conveying it down\n                    the River there, and then it goes by Water to new settled Countries, we\n                    were informed it was as low as 4 or 5 shillings per Bushel, which is\n                        low cheap for a new Country, we found in Canada and other placed Corn Rated at a dollar\n                    per Bushel -- Most of the principal Men in the Village and others gathered \n                     into the house where we were, and\n                    their being a Whiteman living a- -mongst them that could interpret, we\n                    informed them of what we had been doing at Cornplanters settlement, and of the young Men we had left\n                    there to Instruct the Indians to Plough &amp;c, and of friends concern\n                    for the Indians in general; with which they expressed their\n                    satisfaction, saying they took it very kind that we called to see them, and\n                    to inform them of what we had been doing &gt;at Jeniscatago, for they had heard something about it, but\n                    they had nothing further to say, we then shook hands with them\n                        all\n                    round and bid them farewell, We then and turned a\n                    little to the right, leaving Cate- -ragus\n                    considerable to our left, and in about 7 miles of a very swampy\n                    teadious road, through good land abounding with Poplars, and with\n                    other timber heavily loaded, we arrived at Lake\n                        Erie. here we gratifyed our eyes in a while in\n                    viewing this Ob- -sequious Element as far as the Convex state of the\n                    globe would admit, -- here we now \n                     turned still more to the right, and\n                    went along the beach to lake to the mouth of Buf- -folae 29 miles, the prospect the\n                        remainder remaining part of this day was pleasant, and it\n                    was rather heightened by our being so long confined in the Woods. The\n                    road was in places good, but in other places very heavy,\n                    that\n                    being a large the gravel being near fetlock deep. We had the\n                        Lake on our left, the surf roling\n                    gently to the shore in waves two or three feet high. On our Right was a\n                    Majestick ap- -pearance of rocks and stones piled up in verey uniform\n                    order, in places from 20 to 60 feet high, as upright as the Wall of a\n                    house, and in other places projecting over several feet, the bottom of\n                    these Rocks are\n                    wore with the bearing of the Waves, and Sand, and Gravel,\n                        until\n                    they are were wore into Curious shapes, and as smooth as\n                    polished Marble, from the tops of these Rocks the water was\n                    tr trickling down very entertaining, I ob- -served some\n                    Rocks standing in the edge of the Water, as large over, and round as a\n                    Millstone, the upper part whereof \n                     was wore nearly to the shape of the\n                    largest end of an Egg, &amp; as round as if turned in a leathe. In a\n                    number of places the water came up to the Wall of Rocks, so that we\n                    had to ride 40 or more pearch- -es in the Water Lake in places\n                    Belly deep, and the Water was very dirty at the Shore with its beating\n                    the sand &amp;c so that we could not see the bottom, and did not know\n                    but the next step the horses made might take them over their Backs,\n                    but what made it look the most romantic was the continu- -al beating\n                    of the Waves, which came up against these Rocks, and the Wa- -ter\n                    would at times fly over our heads and sufficeintly wet the traveller.\n                    The last 10 miles we very much left the Rocks, and as we advanced the\n                    bank grew lower, so that very high Westerly Winds raises the\n                        Lake water and Waves on this side the\n                    Lake until it overflows the Bank and\n                    drowns a considerable Country, which is very level, and Wet for Common. It\n                    was very evident for a number of Miles here away \n                     that the Lake is gradually moving towards the Southeast as most of\n                    the trees which stand along its margin has the dirt washed away from\n                    their roots for 3, 4, or more feet deep, and so that they are\n                    dead &amp; falling fast; and I thought it was as visible when on the\n                    Canada shore opposite, that the Land was\n                    gaining there. ---- We got to the Mouth of Buffaloe before sunset, where we put our saddles and\n                    Baggage into a boat wich which took us over, and we swam our\n                    horses through the\n                    River it being perhaps near 100 yards wide\n                    and 10 or more feet deep, here we met with a compa- -ny of men who\n                    were going to run out Robert Morrises\n                    late purchase of the Indians into Townships, John\n                        Thomson an Old acquain- -tance from Delaware County being one of the head Surveyors, he kindly\n                    invited us to stay all night with them, and directed a Tent to be put\n                    up for us, we acknowledged his kindness, and accepted his offer, after\n                    feeding our horses we turned them out to bare picking in\n                    an open bottom, we were kind -ly entertained, with great symplycity,\n                    on Bread, Fish, and Chocolate; we got a pretty good nights rest, which\n                    we wanted being weary having traveled 45 miles, no white inhabitant for the\n                    last 80 miles \n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 42.53357, "lon": -78.552574}, "media": {"caption": "Page: 113", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "June 09, 1798", "text": "\n                \n                9th\n                    \n\n                This Morning went 4 miles on the Beach down the Lake and the River Niagara,\n                    which is the outlet of said Lake, to the\n                    Narrows, wh were we Crossed the River into upper Ca-\n                        -nada, it was &#190; of a Mile wide about 16 feet deep, and a\n                    rough Strong Current, our boat was narrow and tottering, and one of\n                    the horses a little unruly so that we felt thankful when we got safely on\n                    shore, we then turned square to our left, up the side of the River to the Lake,\n                    passing by Fort Erie, then up the Margin\n                    of the Lake on a fine firm beech that\n                    made a beautiful Road 6 or 7 miles, then turning square to our right\n                    in about 1 &#189; miles ar- -rived at Daniel\n                        Pounds, where we were kindly received, and felt thankful,\n                    we were once more among our friends.

As far as I have\n                    been \n                     through it, in the general it is a\n                    level Country, while in a state of Woods, much of it is Wet, with a\n                    black mud on the top and a stiff Clay under, which Clay prevents the\n                    Water from soaking down, when cleared in a dry time this Clay land\n                        beakes bakes very hard &amp; is difficult tilling, tho in\n                    other places the soil it is a loamy soil.\n                    The land in general is of a good quality and a fine grass land, good\n                    springs of water are scarce, as are lively runing Streams: and the\n                    Waters fail much in dry Weather. In places there are a plenty of a\n                    coarse flinty Limestone, but in the general few stones are to be seen,\n                    Scarcely a spot to be met with, except where it is cleaned, but what\n                    is very heavy, Timbered Land. I do not recollect of ever passing through\n                    a Country that has so large a proportion of clean, straight, beautiful\n                    White lakes as a considerable part of this has; there are also a\n                    Considerable quantity of \n                     White and Black Ash, Poplar, Chesnut,\n                    Elm, Shellbark Hiccory, Bass Wood or Lyn, Sugar Maple, Beech, White\n                    Pine &amp;c. When the roads are first opened and used they are mostly\n                    muddy, in places very deep, but after they have been used 8 or 10 years and\n                    the Roots rotten and gone, they get pretty good, tho at present there\n                    are amany deep places. as far as I can learn their Summers are plea-\n                    -sant tho nearly, in the daytime, as warm as our own are, but the evenings\n                    and nights mostly cool, so that a blanket &amp; Cover- -lit are not\n                    often unpleasant sleeping under, -- there Winters are steady and more\n                    Snow lies on the ground than in our parts, but in convesation with some who\n                    moved out of\n                    these parts the Jersyes and Pennsylvania, they were of the Mind we have\n                    a many days here, as cold as any they have there, but we have\n                    more warm ones, their Win- -ters mostly set in towards the middle of\n                    the 12th Mo, and in the forepart of winter they have frequent snows,\n                    until the ground becomes 18, 20, or 24 Inches deep, but seldom more,\n                    which snow continues without much additi- -on until the Middle of the third\n                    Month, which \n                     which is their pleasantest time for\n                    traveling in the whole Year, they do their Carting and traveling much\n                    with Sleds, the roads be- -come smooth and good, there are no swam ps\n                    or mud in the way, neither is the snow often softened with rain in the\n                    Winter, some seasons they have had very little or no frost in the\n                    Ground; and as far as they have tryed Cover, they say it does\n                    answers very well, not being hurt in the winter, with frost.\n                 About 9 O Clock this morning we took leave of our kind, and Valued friends\n                        Asa Schooly and Wife, with their\n                    children, hav- -ing their, and many friends, hearty Wishes for our\n                    safe return, stoped at\n                    Daniel Pounds, a little while, then tak-\n                    -ing our leave of them, and set of down the Lake for Buffaloe,\n                    &amp; arrived at the fer- -ry about 12 where we found the Chief fer-\n                    -ryman, so in Liquor as not to be fit to take any Care, but a trusty Old\n                    man who sometimes Assisted agreed to take us over, the Wind was pretty\n                    high, and the River ran swift, he\n                    concluded to lash two boats together to keep the one our horse\n                        was were \n                     in Studier, which was very acceptable\n                    to us, having found when we Crossed before were going\n                    over, that it was a dangerous ferry, and rocking boat; but now\n                    on our return we went over very steady, tho the Current beat us down\n                    the River &#190; of a Mile, shortly after we\n                    had got on Shore, and mounted, we saw a man at a great distance towards\n                    Buffaloe, coming riding towards us, whom\n                    we presently knew to be our Indian John\n                    who was coming to meet look for us, he appeared much pleased to\n                        see meet us, as we did to see him, and to find that our Mare\n                    was safe. ----\n                 We got to Buffoloe about 2 OClock and\n                    tho a Day later than we agreed to meet\n                    Cornplanter here, yet neither he nor any\n                    of his company were come, -- about Sunset his Son Henry, and another Indian arrived and informed\n                    us that Cornplanter, and 10 or 12 more\n                    were on there way, and would be here by 10 OClock tomorrow, 15 miles\n            \n            "}}, {"location": {"lat": 42.5417, "lon": -78.5058}, "media": {"caption": "Pages: 125, 126", "url": "https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/qi/files/fullsize/4e0fe986a9716456496045d5fe4f608f.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "June 15, 1798", "text": "\n                15\n                    \n                 About 12 OClock Cornplanter and his\n                    company arrived at the Opposite side of Buf-\n                        -faloe, we walked down to the River to recieve them, when the Landed came\n                    across, they appeared please d \n                     to see us, Cornplanter enquiring after our health since we left him,\n                    he gave us a letter from our friends dated 5 days after we came away,\n                    informing they were well in health, and enjoyed a peaceful Mind, that\n                    they had got their Corn planted, and were preparing ground for\n                    Popatoes, that there had been much rain since we left them, and that\n                    the gnats and Muschetoes were more trou- blesome than heretofore.\n                \n                    Cornplanter having got some information\n                    that we were a little uneasy about staying as none of Robert Morris's Commissi- -oners were arrived,\n                        he this Afternoon &gt;he took an Oppertunity with us,\n                    Observing that he expected by this time we had seen enough of the\n                    Wilderness to form know, that were people were to be collected\n                    from diffi- -rent parts to do publick business, it required time, and\n                    he hoped if Cap- -tain Chapin should not\n                    arrive this evening to night, \n                     we would try to make ourselves as\n                    hap- -py as we could, and stay a few days long -er, for he had a great\n                    desire we should be with them at the Council, and see that all things\n                    were settled fairly, then we would be able to inform our friends at\n                    home and if they were not settled fairly then we could also\n                    inform our friends.
