The\n                    com-missioners used some endeavours to obtain a fat cow; but as there\n                    was none to be had here, they gave them a quantity of salt beef, pork, and\n                    corn, at which they appeared satisfied. \n            \n            "

Some of the British officers asked them to play, which they\n                    readily did, by putting the instrument to the mouth, and sometimes to\n                    the nose; as handily to the one as the other.\n\n                 This evening had the company of capt. John\n                        Drake, a coaster between this and Mackinaw, distant one hundred and thirty leagues &#8212; sails\n                    in a sloop of se-venty or eighty tons burthen. He gave us some account\n                    of the north-west fur trade, and the man-ner of its being carried on by the\n                    companies con-cerned, who employ many hundred men, that stay many\n                    years in the country, travelling and trading with the northern Indians for\n                    peltry; an abundance of which, of the richest kind, is brought from\n                    the high northern latitudes, which nets the companies very large\n                    profit. But among what people, or in what part of the world, except the\n                        Canadian French, could persons be found\n                    for their purpose, I know not. They are allowed a very small portion\n                    of provisions from this to the Grand\n                        Portage, at the head of Lake\n                        Superior, which is about eight hun-dred miles; there they\n                    are allowed about one bushel (forty-two quarts French measure) of Indian\n                    corn per man, for a year, and a little fat, which they may use at\n                    their own discretion. The corn is pre-pared in a curious manner at\n                         Detroit, being first boiled in\n                    strong lye, which takes off the outside hull; afterwards it is spread out\n                    and dried, then packed up for use. With this they set out, and re-\n                    turn not until the end of the year, when a fresh \n                     supply of goods is taken up with canoes, &amp;c. by many\n                    hundred men to the Portage, where they\n                    ex-change commodities to a very great amount. Thus goes on the trade\n                    from year to year. The men in the north live principally on fish, and the\n                    flesh of beasts of divers kinds, without bread or salt, and when they\n                    return appear as robust and healthy, and even more so than those who live\n                    on the greatest delicacies. The principal fish in Lake Superior are the white fish and salmon trout, which\n                    are fine and delicate: we have eat of them, brought fresh from the\n                    lake to this place in six days. \n                 We understand one M'Kenzie is now out\n                    with ten men, exploring the  North-west\n                        Territory : he once attempted it before; was out more than\n                    a year, and discovered large frozen waters in the north, but, whether\n                    lakes or ocean, he knew not &#8212; supposed the latter, the water being salt. \n\n                \n                    Captain Drake, by his own account, had been\n                    se-veral voyages to Africa, in the horrid\n                    business of fetching slaves, which he now very much condemns. He told\n                    us many curious tales; &#8212; and is certainly a very temperate man with respect\n                    to drink, taking nothing but water &#8212; a rare instance in a seafaring\n                    man. Happy would it be for many thousands in the world, were his example\n                    followed in that re-spect; families would be preserved from ruin and\n                    distress, morality increase, the poor Indians be saved from many acts of\n                    violence, and the end of our creation be more fully answered by\n                    honouring God, our Creator. \n            \n            "

The commandant said, that if he apprehended dan-ger\n                    at any time, he should lay his commands on us not to depart the place. But,\n                    although we sought not the protection of military power, we were not\n                    insensible of his great good will towards us, which we were not wanting to\n                    acknowledge. \n\n                 Visits from the Indians are almost every day re-peated, by different tribes\n                    constantly coming in,, this being the thoroughfare for all the northern\n                    In-dians.

We as-sured him we had the same\n                    love and friendship for them and all others, as our forefathers had, and\n                    that our principles had always restrained us from war; and when we\n                    believed the government was disposed \n                     to make peace with them on principles of justice, we were\n                    made willing to leave our homes and take this long journey to endeavour to\n                    promote it, and to be present at the concluding of so good a work. He\n                    said, he knew long ago, we did not fight, but were for peace, and that, as\n                    we had come a long journey, preserved in health, it was evident the\n                    Great Spirit was pleased with our coming, and he hoped some good would be\n                    done, and that the Great Spirit would bring us home in health and\n                    safety. \n\n                 We had a visit also this morning from Abram,\n                    an Indian chief, Katharine his wife, and\n                    their daugh-ters, richly clad, with plates of silver, &amp;c. \n\n                 The introduction of distilled spirits among the people appears to have been\n                    their ruin. The frauds, in consequence of it, imposed upon them, taking\n                    in the ravages and depredations of war made amongst themselves, with\n                    multiplied murders and thefts, seems to have prevented their being a\n                    wealthy peo-ple. The contrary with many is sorrowfully their \n                    situation, I fear to our condemnation; yet the his-tory of Indian\n                    barbarity, and breach of faith to white people, and to one another, which\n                    we have heard related since we came here, would be shock-ing to\n                    recite, and is almost at times ready to stagger the faith of their best\n                    friends. One of the Moravian missionaries\n                    signified his sense, that if peace should be concluded, it would not last\n                    long, until they were further chastised. John\n                        Parrish asked, by what means? Did he mean the sword? He was\n                    answered, yes. This sentiment, from one of those who make profession\n                    of the peaceable principles of the gospel, was really discouraging. \n\n\n                \n                 We often hear many frightful things suggested; as, that we shall be either\n                    killed, or kept as hostages at the ensuing council. This, with the accounts\n                    of the Indian warriors in time past, frequently passing with numbers\n                    of scalps and their disconsolate prisoners, seemed dreadful; yet we are not\n                    discouraged from pursuing our first prospect; believing he that put us\n                    forth, will go before us, if we are not wanting on our part. \n\n                 It must be said to the honour of British humani-ty, and in commendation of\n                    this government of Up-per Canada, and\n                    its truly respectable and generous officers, that they have interfered to\n                    the relief of great numbers of persons, and obtained their redemp-tion\n                    at a great price; divers of whom that we met with appeared as the outcasts\n                    of Europe ; some of them, as colonel England\" and other officers told us,\n                    hardly had manners or gratitude to acknowledge the kindness, though in some\n                    instances it cost one hundred pounds. But in the case of a real\n                    Ameri-can, they never grudged it. \n            \n            "

A\n                    fa-vourable opportunity presenting for a small tour on the water, we,\n                    except William Savery and William Hartshorne, went in a boat, provided by\n                    our friend\n                    William Baker, up the river about nine miles, to\n                    Nathan Williams's, where we were kindly\n                    received, and dined. His place is situate at the entrance of Lake St. Clair. While here, Nathan gave us an\n                    ac-count, that in digging a cave for a root house, they found, about\n                    six feet below the surface of the ground, large quantities of human bones,\n                    that must have been for a long time there: and at another place on the\n                    bank of the lake, it being washed away when the lake was high, there were\n                    seen great numbers of the same kind, which they gathered up and\n                    buried. The Indians said they must have been \n                     from people a great while ago that they knew no-thing of.\n                    There is also near this lake, as we are in-formed, the appearance of old\n                    forts, curiously made in ancient time, where pieces of earthenware are\n                    often found, though large trees are now standing in the entrenchments, of\n                    which the present Indians can give no account. We seem pretty generally\n                    led to believe, from various circumstances, that the na-tives of this\n                    land must be the descendants of old Jacob, and are of the scattered tribes,\n                    who probably found their way here through Russia, and crossed over the narrow strait from Kamschatka to the west side of America. Be all\n                    this as it may, we find them here in great numbers, at present a savage,\n                    barbarous people when at war, and more particularly when in-toxicated\n                    with strong drink, which has been intro-duced by the white people that\n                    suppose themselves by far their superiors in religious and natural\n                    under-standing. Happy would it have been for them and us, had we used\n                    those superior talents, in mercy conferred upon us, more to the honour of\n                    God, by following the example of our holy leader, Christ Jesus, who\n                    said he came not to destroy men's lives, but to save\n                        them. May all Christendom more and more labour to experience a\n                    renovation of heart and mind, submitting and conforming to the will of\n                    hea-ven in all our conduct, consistent with the design of our\n                    creation. Then might we have reason to hope for a blessing on our labours,\n                    tending to stop the effusion of human blood, and the establishment of\n                    Christ's kingdom on the mountain of love and holi-ness, where the lion and\n                    the lamb might lie down together, there being nothing to make us\n                    afraid. In the afternoon we re-embarked and returned to \n                     town. Wm. Savery and Wm. Hartshorne in our absence, were visited by a\n                        Shawnese warrior, who announced to\n                    them what had frequently been sug-gested to us before, by divers persons,\n                    that if the commissioners did not immediately agree that all the land\n                    west of the Ohio should be given up by the\n                    United States, or even hinted any thing to the\n                    con-trary, by offering gifts or money as purchase, that not one of\n                    them or their company would go off the ground alive; for their fathers, who\n                    were all gone, had sold lands for knives, rum, &amp;c. till they were\n                    now driven almost to the sun setting, where they were determined to make a\n                    stand. He also pointed out very sensibly, the sad effects strong drink\n                    had on their fathers in general. He then appeared per-fectly sober &#8212;\n                    informing that four days before he left the Miami\n                        Rapids, a deputation of two chiefs from a tribe, embarked\n                    for Niagara to meet the commis-sioners,\n                    and let them know the outlines of their con-clusions; and that if the white\n                    people would settle to the banks of the Ohio on the east side, and agree that the river should be\n                    the line, they would be glad, and take them by the hand and call them\n                    brothers. But we apprehended no such power lay with the commissioners,\n                    nor of its being the design of govern-ment, &#8212; the cloud looked dark and\n                    heavy, and por-tended some dreadful scenes of desolation, except the\n                    Lord should be pleased, in his abundant mercy, to interpose and spare this\n                    wicked generation. \n\n                 The aforesaid Indian, notwithstanding his sensi-bility and calmness, about\n                    two hours after, returned much intoxicated with rum &#8212; behaved very\n                    rudely, and drew a stroke with his tomahawk at one Sylves-ter Ash, an interpreter, who had long resided with \n                     the Shawnese, and now lives at\n                        Fort Pitt. We sup-posed he had a\n                    grudge against him for leaving them; but Ash prevented his doing him mischief. This, with other\n                    insolent behavior to our landlord, caused\n                    captain Munsey, who was there, to send for\n                    some soldiers to turn him out of the garrison. These things look\n                    gloomy, and tend to confirm us that no-thing short of wisdom from above\n                    will do for us to lean to. \n            \n            "

And truly we have many requests, that in our\n                    pre-sent circumstances we are not able to comply with to the full.\n                        Hendricks' account is more favourable\n                    than some others we have had. He expresses a hope there will be a peace.\n                    The general cry among the gentlemen and more knowing inhabitants of\n                    this place is, for God's sake, gentlemen, don't\n                        venture yourselves to Sandusky. This we believe is from motives of entire\n                    friendship and good will to us, and makes it at times very trying. And\n                    though we have not felt any slavish fears &#8212; yet hope to move\n                    cautiously, as wisdom, which is profitable to direct, may point out the\n                    way.

We held a meeting in the sail loft at the tenth hour,\n                    which was a favour-ed time, it being large and solid. Soon after our\n                    re-turn, we heard of the arrival of the Dunmore at the mouth of the\n                    river, by a passenger who came in her, and that the commissioners are on\n                    board, expecting to go forward soon to Sandusky. In the afternoon we had another comfortable\n                    meeting, crowned as we thought, with the Master's good presence. And\n                    now it looks likely to be a parting one, &#8212; the peo-ple behaved with\n                    remarkable quietness &#8212; manifest-ing much respect to us. I believe there are\n                    a few tender-hearted ones in this place that will remember us, and I\n                    hope we shall not forget them; &#8212; though it is sorrowful to behold the power\n                    and influence that \n                     satan has too generally amongst the inhabitants of these\n                    parts.

This ac-count is more pleasant than any we have had for many\n                    days past. In this fluctuating state of things we find great need to keep\n                    on the right bottom, so that we may not be shaken from that\n                    foundation, and a humble confidence in the Divine power, whichI trust\n                    we felt in our embarkation. \n            \n            "

They appeared uneasy with what had passed at Niagara, asserting that nothing short of\n                        Ohio river being the line, would\n                    satisfy them; they requested the com-missioners&#8217;  answer\n                    to-morrow, on that head, and re-tired over the river. This unexpected\n                    change look-ed again discouraging; believing our worthy com-missioners\n                    had nothing but upright views in their proceedings, consistent with the\n                    trust reposed in them by the government of the United States.

And as they supposed they were\n                    mostly poor people, or they would not have settled on dis-puted lands,\n                    they now proposed that government  should give the money to them. It would\n                    be a suf-ficient compensation to those settlers, and might in-duce\n                    them to move quietly somewhere else, out of the Indian country &#8212; and make\n                    the Ohio the bounda-ry: for it was their\n                    land. And signified, as the land to the westward was filled up, they had\n                    no-where to repair to, and were now determined to lay \n                    their bones in that country. As to the concessions the commissioners\n                    proposed making, by giving mo-ney, they did not want it; and running a new\n                    line was but giving them a part of their own land. And as to\n                    disclaiming the right to all their country by virtue of the peace made with\n                    the king, their father, they knew they never were conquered, and the\n                    pre-emption right agreed on by the British and United States,\n                    concerning the purchasing of their country, could not be binding on them;\n                    for they supposed they had a right to sell their lands to whom they\n                    pleased. Upon the whole, it was received as a very contemptible speech, by\n                    our commissioners &#8212; which soon appeared to be the case, as the baggage\n                    was ordered on board, and caused an alarm in our camp. \n                 Some for safety proposed to lodge on board the ship, and divers tents were\n                    struck. Some went on board, and others took to the house for safety. This\n                    pros-pect, all on a sudden, looked gloomy, and Friends got together to\n                    feel if any thing further opened for us to do. We felt much shut up; &#8212; and\n                    as we had  never been called into council with the commission-ers, nor\n                    had any public conference with the Indians, we were obliged to bear our own\n                    burthens, and sub-mit the awful subject to the interposition of the\n                    Di-vine hand, and turn our faces homeward to our dear friends and\n                    connections, in hopes of reaching our Yearly Meeting. \n\n                 This evening, two runners who were despatched three days ago, returned with\n                    a verbal message from the Five Nations, who\n                    expected us to come for-ward, and were moving six miles down the river\n                    to meet us. They having all along appeared very friendly to the\n                        United States, this appeared an art- ful manoeuvre, on one side or the other. It was somewhat\n                    extraordinary to hear general Lincoln\n                    ex-press, that they had received just such an answer as he could have\n                    wished. What his meaning was, is unknown. Friends slept in their tents as\n                    heretofore, I believe with little fear. \n            \n            "

I was much exercised in mind on that account, being\n                    yet poorly with my cold, which 1 now apprehend to be what is common-ly\n                    called the influenza; &#8212; however, on the whole, I thought I felt most easy\n                    to go forward, and rode into Philadelphia, attended the meeting at Fourth street, which\n                    was a solid, favoured time, though very small. There were some Friends from\n                    every Quarter, though many of the representatives were absent. I think\n                    from one meeting there was but one answered. The number on the women's\n                    side of the house, in the whole, twenty-four. I dined at\n                    Thomas Wistar's, and towards evening returned\n                    to \n                    \n                    Germantown, feeling myself very poorly with\n                    great debility.

The prospect was awful and alarm-ing, to behold the many\n                    new graves, and others dig-ging, with the hearses standing, and some\n                    coming and going &#8212; most of which were attended by the black people,\n                    whom it is said the disorder has not reached. This is a token of mercy,\n                    mixed with judgment, both to them and the whites, they being the\n                    principal nurses and carriers of the dead. I am hardly able to describe my\n                    feelings on the present occasion, believing it to be all in wisdom, and\n                    hoping it may have a tendency to bring the lofty from their seats, and\n                    beget greater humility than has of latter time appeared in that highly\n                    favoured city. \n            \n            "
