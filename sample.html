                    <del>Dinner</del> brought in some dinner in a bark bowl, and<br/> a Tin kettle,

                    kettle, but what<br/> was in either of them we knew not, or<br/> whether they
                    were to be eaten together, or<br/> separate, the bowl contained a number of<br/>
                    round lumps of something tied in Corn<del>hu</del><br/> -husks, two dumplings
                    were tyed in one<br/> set of husks, with a string at each end<br/> and in the
                    middle, we let them know that our<br/> Ignorance was such, we did not know
                    how<br/> to begin, which set some of the younger sort <br/>
                    <pb n="38"/> a laughing, but the Chief took<br/> out
                    his knife, for they had set neither knives,<br/> forks, or spoons, and taking up
                    the<br/> Dumplins he cut one of them in too,<br/> then striping up the

                    <del>his knife</del> he cut off a piece of the dump<br/> -lin, and

                    example, and made<br/> a light meal, the Bears Oyl was Cold and<br/> not
                    grateful to our Pallates, but we have<br/>
                    <del>seen</del> since, seen this way of eating is often prac-<br/> -ticed among
                    them; the Cold Indian Bread<br/> dipped in the Oyl is more frequently used.</p>

                    long journey, for which they were<br/> very glad. He then informed us of their
                    Poverty, the<br/> poorness of their houses which were covered with<br/> bark,
                    and their inability to make good ones, we<br/> thought the latter part of this
                    speech was calculat-<br/> -ed to draw our Charity. he then let us know<br/>

                    <del>had</del> having particularly requested their Women might at-<br/> -tend.
                    We then opened our business by letting <br/>

                    and difficulties of a<br/> perilous Journey, with no other view than<br/> for

                        <p> Brothers the Quakers, <br/> Listen <del>no</del> now to what I<br/> am
                            going to say to you. &#8211; You know<br/> brothers the Red people are poor,
                            the great<br/> Spirit has made them of another language,<br/> so that it
                            is very hard for us to understand<br/> one another plainly, as there is
                            no person<br/> here that can interpret very well. <br/> Brothers, <br/>
                            we take great pains to settle<br/> the proposals you made to us, but we
                            differ<br/> in Opinions, and we must take great<br/> pains to have every
                            thing compleat <br/> Brothers,<br/> we suppose the reason you came
                            here<br/> was to help Poor Indians some way or other,<br/> and you wish
                            the Chiefs to tell their Warriors<br/> not to go on so bad as the have
                            done, and<br/> you wish us to take up work like the white<br/> People,
                            now Brothers some of our sober men<br/> will take take up work, and do
                            as you say,<br/> and if the do well, then will your young<br/> Men stay
                            longer, but some others will not<br/> mind what you say <br/>
                            <pb n="44"/> Brothers,<br/> we cant say a word
                            against you<br/> it is the best way to call Quakers Brothers.<br/> You
                            never wished our lands, you never<br/> wished any part of our Lands,
                            therefore we are<br/> determined to try to learn your ways, and<br/>
                            those young men may stay here two years<br/> to try, by that time we
                            shall know whether<br/> Morris will leave us any land, for last
                            summer<br/> we sold our Land, and we dont know yet<br/> whether we shall
                            get what we reserved, or<br/> wether we shall get our Money, but by
                            that<br/> time we shall know, and then if they like<br/> it, and we like
                            it, your young men may<br/> stay longer.<br/> Brothers,<br/> if your
                            young Men stay here we<br/> want them to lern our Children to read<br/>
                            and Write. <br/> Brothers,<br/> Two of you are going home<br/> again, if
                            the hear any thing about our land,<br/> or our Money, they must write to
                            these young<br/> men here, and the must tell us if we are<br/> like to
                            be Cheated.<br/> Brothers,<br/> this is all I have yet to say.</p>

                    to make a settlement, we<br/> found it a trying Circumstance rightly<br/> to
                    Judge what was best to do on the Occa-<br/> -tion. <a href="#cornp" class="placeName">Jeneocatego</a> the Town where we now<br/> are, being the place of

                    a weighty consideration of making<br/> this the place of settlement, there
                    are<br/> also a large number of Children here<br/> fit for schooling, so that
                    with much con-<br/> -veniency a large school might be<br/> made up, but to
                    ballance these advan-<br/> -tages, we considered the Land was pri-<br/> -vet
                    property, and if we made improv-<br/> -ments , such as building a house and<br/>
                    Barn, and Cleared land, when we left<br/> it they would all belong to <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplan-<br/> -ter</a>, and not to the nation; also if
                    the<br/> Indians where to clear land and fence<br/> lots, they would not belong
                    to the Nati-<br/> -on. this consideration made us believe<br/> it would be best

                    with Hazels<br/> &amp;c and part with grass, that in a few <del>wee</del><br/>
                    weeks would do to mow, and some of the<br/> richest sorts of it are put in
                    with<br/> Corn this Spring; it doth not appear to<br/> have ever been fenced,

                    land, and taking its local situation in<br/> -to consideration, we were united

                    from<br/> the <a href="#alleg" class="geogName">River</a> back, taking in part of the
                    Wood-<br/> -land, would be suitable for our purpose,<br/> and that if they liked
                    it, to tell us, and if the did not<br/> like it, tell us so, and we would look
                    farther<br/> where it would suit them better, they said the<br/> had informed us

                    then said, this man,<br/> meaning one of the Chiefs that was with us,<br/> lives

                    would give them, if they saw a Buck<br/> swimming across the River, or
                    running<br/> through the Woods they might shoot him<br/> or if they saw any fish

                    over, so that it looked very<br/> neat. they plant beans with their Corn, also

                    and Pumpkins among<br/> their corn - The Women since we came here worked<br/>

                    busy time since we came here, the Wo-<br/> -men have rose early, gone out
                    with<br/> their hoes to the Cornfield 4 or 5 in a<br/> Company, some of whom
                    where Old Gray<br/> Headed Women, and some young ones of<br/> 8, 10, or 12 Years
                    of age, stuck pretty<br/> Close to their Work, returned in the even-<br/> -ing
                    weary, and go early to Bed. one<br/> old Gray Headed Woman I have seen<br/>
                    steadily on the move, she has had both<br/> her feet so froze that she goes
                    altogether<br/> on her knees, I have seen her carrying<br/> in wood and making
                    the fire, going to the <a href="#alleg" class="geogName">Ri-<br/> -ver</a> and
                    Bringing up water, I have seen<br/> take her hoe and go 40 pearches out to <br/>

                    Even-<br/> -ing with the Labourers, and put her<br/> hoe by, and all this while
                    the Men are<br/> spending their time in Idleness, such as<br/> shooting with
                    their bows and Arrows at a<br/> mark which is a very great recreation<br/>

                    subsistence<br/> at this season was Corn, beans, and Bears<br/> Oyl, in
                    different preparations, much of their<br/> Corn and Beans, were pounded into an
                    ho-<br/> -miny, and Boiled, this I thought was<br/> their Chief dependence, they
                    also pound<br/> Corn and Beans in to a flour, and make bread<br/> of it, they
                    also boyl it in dumplins, which<br/> they eat with Bear Oyl by dipping it
                    in,<br/> as they do also with their Bread, they<br/>

                    observation they eat much less <del>than</del><br/> than we do, a small piece of
                    Bread or dum-<br/> -plin dipped in the Oyl seemed to satisfy<br/> nature, and

                    11 OClock, and in the Evening, if any<br/> of their friends came to see them,
                    the Visit was<br/> not interrupted with Cookery, or much<br/> Cerimony in laying
                    the table &amp;c. if their hominy<br/> was boiled, which was generally the case
                    af-<br/> -ter 11 OClock, the day through, and it was<br/> not material whether
                    Cold or Warm, and<br/> some of their acquaintance came in, the <br/>

                    wheren<br/> they were presently engaged in smoak-<br/> -ing and talking, and
                    while thus busily<br/> employed, a kettle of hominy with<br/> a large Wooden
                    spoon, is brought and<br/> set down on the Ground before them, he<br/> that is
                    most handy to it lays by his<br/> Pipe, and in a few minutes appears to be<br/>
                    satisfyed with his repast, and moves it on<br/> to the next, while the rest of
                    the Company<br/> are engaged as if no Victuals were<br/> near them, thus the

                    no<br/> hominy, the Bread, or dumplin, goes<br/> round in like manner; there is

                <p> In their Cloathing and Dress their turn<br/> is for something tawdry; such as a

                    particularly. I have seen bobs<br/> of various kinds hanging there noses<br/> to
                    the weight of an Ounce, or more, coming<br/> down over their Mouth. the
                    Warriors<br/> have the rim of their Ears cut round,<br/> and loaded with
                    different kinds of<br/> Toys, until the hang down several<br/> Inches. I saw one
                    man with two padlocks<br/> in one Year, such as are used for Saddle-<br/> bags,
                    another with a Watch, such as<br/> Children use. large silver Crosses are<br/>

                    hangs loose at the<br/> lower end, the Women wearing their<br/>

                    <pb n="62"/> on about 9 Inches of the upper part;
                    their<br/> way of making and putting them on is, to take<br/> a piece of Cloath

                    pap, which Conduct to those<br/> who are unacquainted with it may look<br/>
                    immodest, but it is not the case, for<br/> a Child is so suckled, and less of

                <p> With all their tawdry and liveliness in<br/> dress the go dirty, I thought the

                    black and greesy, from their greesy<br/> heads; their hair I have observed to
                    be<br/> the Cloath to wipe their greasy fingers <br/>
                    <pb n="63"/> in, while eating their bread and
                    Oyl.<br/> thus for want of a change of Cloaths, and<br/> living in their dirt,
                    they become <del>very</del><br/> lowsy, which they try to extrecate them<br/>
                    -selves from, by pulling of their shifts,<br/> turning them inside
                        out<del>wards</del>, and<br/> hunting the Vermon with as much com-<br/>
                    -possure, and seemingly good grace,<br/> as a Mother amongst us would do, in
                    <br/> combing one of her Children, and this<br/> part of their dirt has not been
                    one of the<br/> least of our trials, neither have we any<br/> expectation of
                    leaving them, without<br/> carrying away some breeders. </p>
                <p> For more than two weeks past the weather<br/> has been very dry, part of the
                    time a Cold<br/> north wind, we had frost for ten Mornings<br/> successively,
                    during which time we slept<br/> in open Cabins, in our blankets, so that<br/> we
                    sensible felt the want of more cover-<br/> -ing, and a better Bed before
                    morning.<br/> for two or three days past the weather has<br/> been warm, with a

                    <pb n="64"/> have frequently covered us, so that
                    the<br/> Sun has been hid. A curious Sight present-<br/> -ed two nights ago, of
                    some neighbouring<br/> Hills or rather mountains that were on fire,<br/> perhaps
                    the had not been burnt for seve-<br/> -ral Years, and the great quantity of
                    dead<br/> timber, both standing and laying down,<br/> having taken fire as it
                    passed along,<br/>
                    <del>which</del> made a very lively appearance in<br/> the night, looking as if

                <p> Our young men this morning planted<br/> some Potatoes, and they are now
                    pre-<br/> -paring <del>some</del> ground fit for the Plough, for<br/> Corn,
                    having when we came up borrow-<br/> -ed some tools of <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplanter</a>. we had<br/> a present of fish this morning, on
                    which<br/> we expect deliciously to dine, - Our<br/> Young Men have prepared
                        <del>some</del> bobs<br/> in order to try to catch some Eells<br/> this
                    evening, set of up the <a href="#alleg" class="geogName">River</a><br/> with a Canoe,
                    but there being a con-<br/> -siderable rapid to ascend, which for<br/> want of
                    more experience in working<br/> the vessel, they fail&#8217;d getting up, the
                    Canoe<br/> turning across the Stream in such a<br/> manner, that it took in
                    Water, and<br/> presently turned bottom upwards, so<br/> that some of them got
                    very wet, which<br/> put an end to their Eel catching; shortly<br/> after they
                    returned we had several very<br/> heavy showers, <del>wich</del> which
                    convinced<br/> us our house was not proof against <br/>
                    <pb n="69"/> Storms, for the rain beat in at the
                    end,<br/> Roof, and other places. &#8211;- </p>
                <p> We have been keeping house about a<br/> week, and experience much
                    inconveni-<br/> -ency for want of the arrival of our<br/> goods, having but five
                    Tins, three<br/> Spoons, and a Camp kettle, we have a<br/> small frying pan
                    which we borrowed<br/> of the Indians, dish cloths, and towels<br/> we are much
                    at a loss for, as we are<br/> for Soap when we wash our Cloaths,<br/> the want
                    of something to knead our bread<br/> in is sensibly experienced, which
                    would<br/> not be the case if we had Tools; when<br/> we fry our meat, or our
                    fritters, we have<br/> neither Dish, nor plate to put them on, but oc-<br/>
                    -cupy bark. We brought Bacon with<br/> us from <a href="#pitts" class="placeName">Pittsburgh</a>, which we have us-<br/> -ed very spareingly, it is
                    nearly run<br/> out, and our Cheese quite. we have no pros-<br/> -pect of
                    supplying their place until our<br/> goods arrive. we have a little flour
                    left<br/> that we brought from <a href="#frank" class="placeName">Franklin</a>,
                    Cho-<br/> -colate &amp; Sugar that we brought from <a href="#pitts" class="placeName">Pitts-<br/> Burgh</a>, which are our chief living and depen-<br/>
                    -dance. <del>as</del> we have received some Sugar of the <br/>
                    <pb n="70"/> Indians as a present, and some we
                    pur-<br/> -chased, which we find a pretty good sub-<br/> -stitute for butter,
                    and Cheese, by bitting<br/> a bit of Sugar, which is in a hand cake,<br/> with
                    our Bread. &#8211; while at the <a href="#cornp" class="placeName">lower<br/> Town</a> we
                    got 2 Quarts of Milk a day,<br/> but since we came here we have re-<br/> -cieved

                <p> I neglected noting in its<br/> proper place, that fifth day last about 11<br/>
                    OClock we retired into our humble Cabin,<br/> and were favoured to witness the
                    over-<br/> -shadowing Wing of Consoling goodness,<br/> to the Comforting and
                    contriting of our<br/> Spirits, and this day we had a like Op-<br/> -pertunity,

                    came to this <a href="#genes1" class="placeName">Town</a>, we brought but<br/>
                    little provision with us here, having<br/> but little to bring, and had a hope
                    we<br/> should have been able to have got<br/> some dryed Venison of the Indians
                    here, which has<br/> not been the case, we got a little Bears Oyl<br/> of them,
                    but that article is scarce, and<br/> dear, this day intending to have made <br/>
                    <pb n="72"/> a dinner of some flitters, our Bread<br/>
                    being nearly out, and our flour so re-<br/> -duced as to discourage attempting
                    to<br/> bake; while we were frying our<br/> flitters, an Indian man came in<br/>
                    <del>in</del> and presented us with about four Pounds of fresh Ve-<br/> -nison
                    without any bone in it; part of<br/> which we immediately fryed, which<br/> with
                    our flitters made us the most a-<br/> -greeable dinner we have met with<br/> in
                    the Indian Country, we sat down<br/> to it with thankful hearts for so
                    unex-<br/> -pected a supply. we gave the Indian<br/> a Quarter of a dollar, for
                    his Venison,<br/> which he recieved with an apparant<br/> reluctance, but as he
                    could not speak <del>no</del><br/> English, we were altogether at a loss<br/> to
                    know, whether it proceeded from<br/> what we gave him being too much, or<br/>
                    too little, but the same afternoon he took<br/> three of us down in a Canoe to
                        <a href="#cornp" class="placeName">Corn-<br/> -planters Village</a> to attend a
                    general<br/> Council that was to be held there<br/> tomorrow, he took the Money
                    with him<br/> and gave it to <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplanter</a>, and
                    said<br/> something to him in Indian, which <del>being</del><br/> was, that the
                    Venison he brought us was <br/>
                    <pb n="73"/> a gift, and he wished not to recieve
                    any<br/> money for it, and the money was handed back<br/> to us, which we
                    immeadiately presented to<br/> him for <del>his</del> the <del>his</del> trouble
                    of bringing<br/> us down in his Canoe, which he reciev-<br/> -ed with

                    most respectable Women, early<br/> in the Oppertunity <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplanter</a> made a pretty<br/> length speech, <del>which</del>

                            it; you must find half the Mo-<br/> -ney to build this Mill, and we will

                <p> We then were favoured seriouly to<br/> expostulate with them on various
                    subjects<br/> retative to their Moral, and Civil Con-<br/> -duct, particularly
                    there excessive use<br/> of Strong drink, divers instances of<br/> which we had
                    been Eye witnesses of,<br/> since among them, several of their Wo-<br/> -men

                    and heard us<br/> with attention, but as far as I have ob-<br/> -served since
                    among them, little or no<br/> Shame covers an Indian for getting<br/> drunk. --
                    They informed us they<br/> would withdraw a little while into ano-<br/> -ther
                    Room, and confer on our propos-<br/> -als, which doing, in about an hour<br/>
                    they returned, and made us an answer<br/> in substance as follows,</p>
                
                    <body>
                        <pb n="79"/>
                        <p> Brothers, we now hear all what you would<br/> wish to do among us; you
                            are come here<br/> to see us Brothers; you wish us well; you<br/> wish
                            us to become as the White People;<br/> the White People are rich and got
                            every<br/> thing, the Indians are Poor, and <del>got</del> have<br/>
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, you told us one thing; it be<br/> good for us to build a Mill;
                            we must<br/> find 400 dollars, and you will find<br/> 400 dollars.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, we cant say but few Words<br/> at this time about this Mill;
                            we<br/> will consult <a href="#ichap1" class="persName">Captain Chapin</a>,
                            if he<br/> thinks we will recieve our money;<br/> and will be able to
                            raise the money you<br/> propose, then we will do it</p>
                        <p> Brothers, we know how far you have come<br/> to see us, it is a great
                            way; from the<br/> Seashore where our forefathers once liv-<br/> -ed:
                            the White People have cheated us,<br/> and got our land from us, and now <br/>
                            <pb n="80"/> we have but little left, we will
                            try to<br/> learn your way.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, you know there are some<br/> bad People amongst us, and you
                            know<br/> we have been cheated, and that makes<br/> us bad, and our
                            Minds uneasy; if we<br/> had not been cheated we should have<br/> been
                            very rich People, and had plen-<br/> -ty of every thing, and then our
                            Minds<br/> would be easy, and we could think on<br/> the good
                            Spirit.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, the reason I mention to you a-<br/> -bout our being Cheated,
                            some of my War-<br/> -riors wont mind what I say unto them;<br/> but
                            will have their own way, because<br/> they know I often have been
                            Cheated<br/> by the White People; If I had never been<br/> cheated, then
                            my Warriors would believe<br/> me, and mind what I say to them, but<br/>
                            now they wont mind.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, we cant all go to work at once<br/> some of my Warriors will
                            go a hunting<br/> to get Provisions, and sometimes they broke <br/>
                            <pb n="81"/> a Gun, and then it takes a great
                            deal of<br/> money to get a new one, we have very<br/> few Hoes, and
                            Axes, and such things amon-<br/> -gst us, and we are not able to get
                            them.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, I will go along with you to <a href="#canan" class="placeName">Canan<br/>
                                darque</a>, and there we will get matters settled<br/> about
                            the Mill, and bring it back to your<br/> young men in Writing.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, this is all I have <del>now</del> got to say<br/> we will now
                            Shake hands.</p>
                    </body>
                

                <p> At the close of this speech we expressed a few words<br/> more, representing
                    among other things the un-<br/> -reasonableness of their present practice,
                    of<br/> their Mothers, Wives, and Sisters, working<br/> all day in the fields,
                    and in the Woods, with<br/> their hoes, and axes, whilst they themselves<br/>
                    were at the same time playing with their<br/> Bows and Arrows &amp;c
                    recommending to them<br/> to begin our way by early setting their boys<br/> to
                    business, taking them out to how Corn &amp;c<br/> thus by early habitting them
                    to Work, their<br/> Minds will be turned to it, business will<br/> become
                    familier, and they will not think<br/> hard of it. and as they expressed the
                    White<br/> People were rich and had plenty, we let them <br/>
                    <pb n="82"/> know it was by industry it Was
                    obtained<br/> the men doing their share of business<br/> in the fields, &amp;c
                    thereby leaving the Wo-<br/> -men more time to attend to spinning,<br/> sewing,
                    darying &amp;c in the house.</p>
                <p> We concluded with seriously impressing<br/> on their Minds the remembrance,
                    that<br/> it was from the good Spirit they re-<br/> -cieved every good thing,
                    and that he<br/> could hear every good Word they said,<br/> and see every thing
                    they did, and if they<br/> were good, and industerous, this good<br/> Spirit
                    would love them, and bless them<br/> with many good things. In a few
                    minutes<br/> after we had concluded, and informed them<br/> we had done,
                        <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplanter</a> Observed, now<br/> all things
                    were done, and settled, we<br/> will cover up the Council fire.</p>
                <p> We had no provision of our own here,<br/> therefore concluded to stay and dine
                    with<br/> the Chief, about five Oclock we had a<br/> loaf of Warm Indian Bread
                    with a mix-<br/> -ture of Beans that had been boiled till<br/> they were softish
                        <del>nea</del> kneaded up in it<br/>
                    <del>the Bread and baked</del>
                    <del>that was</del>
                    <del>set before us,</del> the<br/> bread <del>had been</del>
                    <del>was</del> baked in a Dutch Oven <br/>
                    <pb n="83"/> having a small quantity of Bears Oyl
                    put<br/> into the oven with it, and when part<br/> baked the loaf was turned
                    over with a<br/> fresh supply of Oyl, <del>we t</del> this was all we<br/> had
                    set before us; they informed us they had no<br/> meat, and we had heretofo shewn
                    our dislike<br/> to bread diped in Oyl; however with a<br/> good Appatite it
                    went down very well, but<br/> before we had fully done a little butter was<br/>
                    set before us <del>on the Table</del> that they had obtained some<br/> -where in
                    the Village. -- We now got half<br/> a &#163; of flour of <a href="#cornp" class="persName">Cornplanter</a> for which he<br/> made no charge, and four Quarts of
                    bears<br/> Oyl of his wife, which she claiming as her<br/> property charged us
                    half a dollar a Quart,<br/> these our Young men took up this evening with

                    two Men<br/> with naked Arms, Thighs, and legs,<br/> they had Bearskins on their

                    they had a grim and Terrible<br/> appearance, this false face, for so it
                    was<br/> called, was made as frightfull as nature<br/> could invent, the hair on

                    <pb n="110"/> was wore nearly to the shape of the

                    number of places<br/> the water came up to the Wall of Rocks,<br/> so that we
                    had to ride 40 or more pearch-<br/> -es in the <del>Water</del> Lake in places
                    Belly deep,<br/> and the Water was very dirty at the<br/> Shore with its beating
                    the sand &amp;c so<br/> that we could not see the bottom, and<br/> did not know
                    but the next step the<br/> horses made might take them over<br/> their Backs,
                    but what made it look<br/> the most romantic was the continu-<br/> -al beating
                    of the Waves, which came<br/> up against these Rocks, and the Wa-<br/> -ter
                    would at times fly over our heads<br/> and sufficeintly wet the traveller.
                    The<br/> last 10 miles we very much left the Rocks,<br/> and as we advanced the

                    knees,<br/> and at the edge I found the Rock was<br/> hollow under me for a
                    number of feet<br/> back, and not much above one foot<br/> thick, I would have
                    been glad to have<br/> descended to the bottom of this pitch, but<br/> we had no
                    pilat, and there was no possibility<br/> of getting down any where in view, nor

                    general note of the face of the<br/> Country, Timber &amp;c. As far as I have
                    been <br/>
                    <pb n="120"/> through it, in the general it is a
                    level<br/> Country, while in a state of Woods, much<br/> of it is Wet, with a
                    black mud on the<br/> top and a stiff Clay under, which<br/> Clay prevents the
                    Water from soaking<br/> down, when cleared in a dry time<br/> this Clay land
                        <del>beakes</del> bakes very hard &amp;<br/> is difficult tilling, tho in
                    other places the soil <del>it</del><br/> is <del>a</del> loamy <del>soil</del>.
                    The land in general is<br/> of a good quality and a fine grass land,<br/> good
                    springs of water are scarce, as are<br/> lively runing Streams: and the
                    Waters<br/> fail much in dry Weather. In places<br/> there are a plenty of a
                    coarse flinty<br/> Limestone, but in the general few stones<br/> are to be seen,
                    Scarcely a spot to be met<br/> with, except where it is cleaned, but what<br/>
                    is very heavy, Timbered Land. I do<br/> not recollect of ever passing through
                    a<br/> Country that has so large a proportion<br/> of clean, straight, beautiful
                    White lakes<br/> as a considerable part of this has; there<br/> are also a

                    the Roots<br/> rotten and gone, they get pretty good, tho<br/> at present there

                    -quest, of last evening, I felt my Mind<br/> this Morning easy to move
                    homewards, but<br/> upon mentioning it to my Companion<br/> he said he did not
                    witness that clear-<br/> -ness to set out he wished to experience<br/> yet
                    condescended if I thought best of<br/> letting the Chief know, that upon<br/>
                    weighing his request in the best man-<br/> -ner we could, We felt easy to
                    move<br/> homewards this morning; this infor-<br/> -mation was given him by
                    walking<br/> down to his encampment, he with a<br/> number of others pretty soon
                    came up to<br/> our lodgings, and let us know, he was<br/> sorry we could not
                    make our Minds easy<br/> to have stayed a few days longer, no ways<br/> doubting
                    but <a href="#ichap1" class="persName">Captain Chapin</a> and others concerned<br/>
                    would be here to day; but perhaps<br/> as we had been a considerable time
                        <del>fr</del><br/> from home, and living was expensive,<br/> we might be
                    much run out of the means <br/>

                    us so anxious to return. I informed<br/> him, when I left home, I expected to
                    have<br/> returned in about 40 days, that it was now<br/> near 50 days, and if
                    we went by <a href="#oneid" class="placeName">Oneida</a><br/> to see the Indians
                    there, which we proposed,<br/> it would take near 30 days more before we<br/>

                    in the way, for we had<br/> plenty. he said he had left home on pub-<br/> -lic
                    Business, expecting to have return-<br/> -ed in 50 or 60 days, and it had taken
                    him<br/> near a Year before he had got back, and<br/> that he had found it his

                    us do so too:<br/> we let him know, the business we came<br/> about appeared to

                    informed us he was become per-<br/> -fectly reconciled to our going, and as<br/>
                    the Council was expected every<br/> day to meet, he could not go with us<br/> to
                        <a href="#canan" class="placeName">Canandargue</a>, as he had proposed,<br/> but

                    at our own<br/> homes, he further desired we would<br/> make ourselves,

                    for he would take<br/> the necessary care of them, and that they<br/>

                <p> Much of this days ride was through a country<br/>

                    grown over with plenty of pretty good grass,<br/> so that I thought thousands of

                    species of large flies, and Musche-<br/> -toes, we stoped twice to let our
                    horses eat <br/>
                    <pb n="130"/> grass, but they were so Worried with
                    these<br/> Animals, that the did little but run about<br/> until we got bushes
                    and kept them of.<br/> If we stoped our horses one Minute in<br/> some places in
                    the Woods, the Musche-<br/> -toes would be on them in such swarms<br/> as almost
                    to hide their natural Colour,<br/> and none but those who have experienced<br/>
                    <del>it</del> the trial can rightly form an Idea, how trou-<br/> blesome the

                    with my Silk handkerchief, laped<br/> my Pocket do: around one of my hands<br/>
                    and with all the <del>other</del> defence I could<br/> make was much bit and
                    Swelled with<br/> them, -- When Night came <del>an</del> we got<br/> no relief,
                    we took up our quarters, a-<br/> -bout Sunset, beside a small stream<br/> of
                    good Water, under the Boughs of an<br/> Oak, and erected fires, in
                    diffirent<br/> places around us in order to smoke<br/> them of, but with all our
                    defence we<br/> were worried the whole night throug[h] <br/>
                    <pb n="131"/> So that we slept but little, our
                    horses,<br/> as may readily be supposed, fared no<br/> better, they would away
                    out to eating,<br/> and then in a little time return trot-<br/> -ting back to
                    the fire, and it was with with<br/> much difficulty we got them sad-<br/> -dled

                    found no diminution<br/> of the Muschetoes, but about noon we ar-<br/> -rived

                    much of this Country<br/> is scarce of Springs, or streams of<br/> Water, and

                    that it had made them feel, to use there<br/> own expressions, very ugly, we let
