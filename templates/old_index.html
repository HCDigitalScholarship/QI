    <h1> Beyond Penn's Treaty: Quaker and Indian Relations</h1>
    <p>William Penn’s original intention to treat American Indians fairly in land “sharing” was soon overridden by the land hunger of Europeans. Different notions of land “use” and “ownership” became ever more critical as the two groups struggled to find ways to co-exist. Nevertheless, part of Penn’s vision lived on in the memory and policies of a community of Quakers who maintained—and continuously updated—a commitment to American Indians.</p>

        <br>
        <p class = "text-left">With the help of X number of students and people, we have been able to digitally transcribe many of the documents we have related to Quaker and Indian affairs in the late 18th to 19th century. But, we still have many more diaries and records to transcribe. Help in the efforts to transcribe and add to the information available on this website.
