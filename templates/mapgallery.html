<p>Maps were very important to the Quakers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Travelling ministers frequently carried manuscript maps showing the roads and the distances between Quaker meeting houses. But they also carried printed maps as well. Isaac Coates, for instance, showed Reading Howell's map of Pennsylvania (first published in 179s) to Cornplanter in 1798. Some of the manuscript maps in this collection were copied from earlier printed versions.
