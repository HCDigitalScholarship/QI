                    <br/>Friend and Sister

                <p> This is to let you know I am much<br/> rejoiced to see friend <a href=""#jclar1"" class=""persName"">Joseph Clark</a>, come by the side of our<br/> fire
                    place, and bring our Girls home. I can not but<br/> bless the great good Spirit
                    for his great goodness in preserving<br/> our long absented Girls from various
                    dangers and that<br/> they have found favour in the sight of such good Friends,
                    as to<br/> take them under their benevolent care and instruct them<br/> in good
                    things and ways; I acknowledge that you have done<br/> a great deal for us, out
                    of love to the Great good Spirit and<br/> your fellow Creatures, that we poor
                    Natives might as it were<br/> rise up &amp; walk, and follow the good path which
                    you follow, by which<br/> I always feel thankful &amp; hope you will not lose
                    your reward<br/> in Heaven, I feel our obligations are increased as our
                    advanta<br/>-ges are increased to serve God in sincerity and in truth.</p>
                    <p>The
                    Religion is somewhat low amongst us, but Christians<br/> seem to keep on still,
                    there has been but a few careless ones<br/> stir'd up for soul Concern, since
                    your young Men left us, who<br/> were at <a href=""#oneid"" class=""placeName"">Oneida</a>, but others seem still to remain in the bon<br/>dage of
                    Spiritual Pharaoh, but God is able to turn their hearts<br/> and make them
                    willing to walk towards Canaan.</p><p> I have no time to express as I feel, but to
                    conclude with your<br/> prayers that the Great good Spirit may pour down his
                    bless<br/>ings upon Us, that religion may again revive among us.</p>
